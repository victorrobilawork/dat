ONE OF THE CENTERFOLD PICTURES,
 ONE OF THE CENTERFOLD PICTURES, WHICH I CALL "THE BLACK SHEETS"
 WHICH I CALL "THE BLACK SHEETS" FOR OBVIOUS REASONS,
 FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, I THINK OF THAT CHARACTER
 I THINK OF THAT CHARACTER AS HAVING JUST WOKEN UP
 AS HAVING JUST WOKEN UP FROM, LIKE, A NIGHT OUT
 FROM, LIKE, A NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN, AND SHE'S JUST
 ON THE TOWN, AND SHE'S JUST GONE TO BED, LIKE,

 "THE BLACK SHEETS," YOU KNOW, IT WOULD STILL BE
 YOU KNOW, IT WOULD STILL BE AMBIGUOUS ENOUGH.
AMBIGUOUS ENOUGH.
I GUESS I COULD'VE

 GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT FOR THAT ONE.
CALLING IT "THE BLACK SHEETS"
 CALLING IT "THE BLACK SHEETS" ISN'T ANY MORE INTERESTING
 ISN'T ANY MORE INTERESTING THAN "UNTITLED NUMBER 79"
 THAN "UNTITLED NUMBER 79" OR WHATEVER IT IS.
OTHER SERIES, I'VE BEEN
