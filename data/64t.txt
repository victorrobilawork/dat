 - I GET VERY POSSESSIVE  OF MY PLACES,  
 AND I DON'T WANT  ANY OTHER ARTISTS  
 COMING AROUND HERE  AND MESSING AROUND  
 AND PAINTING MY PLACES.
I WANT IT TO MYSELF.
- I LIVE HERE IN THE COUNTRY,  AND I SEE SUNLIGHT  
 AND GREAT CLOUD FORMATIONS  
 AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF  ALL THE TIME,  
 BUT I'M NEVER AWARE  OF ANY OF THAT  
 COMING INTO MY ART EVER.
- I VERY MUCH LIKE  THE EXPERIENCE OF VIEWING  
 TO BE ONE OF DISCOVERY,  
 THAT YOU DON'T WALK IN,  SOMETHING IS PRESENTED,  
 AND IT'S FRAMED,  AND IT SAYS,  
 "THIS IS IMPORTANT;  I'M ART."
â™ª  â™ª   
 - I WAS DRIVING  ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE,  
 AND THERE WAS  THIS ENDLESSNESS IN TEXAS.
THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING.
IT IS DESERTS,  AND THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT  
 OF SCRUBBY VEGETATION  HERE AND THERE,  
 THEN SUDDENLY, IN THE MIDDLE  OF ALL THIS EMPTINESS,  
 WERE THESE PINK MOUNTAINS  AROUND THE EDGE OF IT.
EVERY DIRECTION,  THERE WERE THESE HILLS.
PERCHED AROUND  IN THIS EMPTY LANDSCAPE  
 WERE THESE  TINY LITTLE STRUCTURES  
 MADE OUT OF PIPE  WITH CORRUGATED ROOFS ON THEM.
OF COURSE, IN THE DESERT,  
 SHADE IS THE MOST  PRICELESS THING YOU CAN GET,  
 SHADE AND WATER.
TOOK ME AN HOUR OR SO  
 TO UNDERSTAND  THAT IT WAS A RACETRACK,  
 AND SO THESE CORRUGATED ROOFS,  
 THEY WERE SHELTERS  FOR THE HORSES.
THERE WAS A JUDGE'S TOWER,  
 AND THEN THERE WERE  TWO SPECTATOR SHELTERS.
I WAS FASCINATED BY THESE  LOVELY LITTLE AIRY STRUCTURES  
 WHICH LIVED SO LIGHTLY  ON THIS EARTH.
AND I ENDED UP MAKING  
 FIVE DRAWINGS  THAT REALLY INTERESTED ME.
ONE OF THEM I NEVER PAINTED,  
 BUT I MADE FOUR LARGE PAINTINGS  THAT WENT TOGETHER.
THEY WERE ALL THE SAME HEIGHT.
TWO WINTERS, I SPENT  ON THOSE FOUR PAINTINGS.
I WAS INTERESTED IN SPARSENESS  AND EXTREME CLARITY.
EACH THING WAS DIFFERENT.
MOUNTAINS WERE PINK.
THE STRUCTURES  WERE SILVERY WHITE.
THE DESERT FLOOR  WAS A SANDY Ã©LOW.
I ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT  SOME NEW TUBES OF PAINT.
I FIRST CAME OUT TO MARFA  BECAUSE OF THE MOUNTAINS.
I HAD BEEN PAINTING  FOR MANY YEARS  
 IN NEW JERSEY,  WHICH IS FLAT,  
 AND THE TEXAS COAST  NEAR GALVESTON AND HIGH ISLAND  
 AND BEAUMONT,  ALL FLAT AS COULD BE.
I'D BEEN TO UTAH.
I'D BEEN AND SEEN  THESE MAGNIFICENT MOUNTAINS.
AND THESE WEREN'T MAGNIFICENT,  AND I LIKED THAT ABOUT THEM.
IN THE MEANTIME,  OF COURSE,  
 I CAME OUT HERE  AND PAINTED JUDD'S BUILDINGS  
 INSTEAD OF THE MOUNTAINS.
THOSE TWO BUILDINGS THERE  
 STANDING IN THE PRAIRIE  LIKE THAT  
 WITHOUT THEIR OTHER TEN,  
 THOSE SITES  WERE A LITTLE BIT LIKE  
 RUINS AND CONSTRUCTION SITES  BOTH AT ONCE  
 BECAUSE THEY WERE  ABANDONED CONSTRUCTION SITES.
I WAS FASCINATED  BY THOSE THINGS.
THEY WEREN'T SHAPES  OUR CULTURE TEACHES US  
 THAT BUILDINGS  SHOULD BE IN.
AND THEN I CAME  DOWN TO PRESIDIO  
 AND IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED  TO THOSE SAND HILLS UP THERE.
THEY'RE NOT  CLASSIC MOUNTAINS AT ALL.
THEY'RE VERY ODD.
YOU'VE GOT HEIGHT,  AND YOU'VE GOT DEPTH.
LOOKING DOWN AND LOOKING UP  ARE REAL IDEAS IN PAINTING,  
 AND THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT  FROM PAINTING ON THE FLATSCAPE  
 OR PAINTING ON THE LEVEL GROUND.
I WAS ASTONISHED  AT THE DRAMA OF THE LIGHT  
 AS IT MOVED  AROUND THOSE FORMS  
 AND THE WAY THOSE SHADOWS WERE,  FIRST ON ONE SIDE  
 AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE LATE AFTERNOON,  
 TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
IT'S NOT MY DRAMA.
IT'S A DRAMA OF THE SUN  
 MAKING THIS EFFECT  ON THAT MOUNTAIN.
I WANT TO KEEP  MY EMOTIONS OUT OF IT.
MY EMOTIONS SHOULD BE  
 THE EMOTION OF RESPECT  FOR THAT FORM,  
 ALMOST REVERENCE.
I GO OVER  THAT SAME LITTLE SHADOW  
 OVER AND OVER AGAIN  TILL I GET THAT SHAPE.
IT HAS A CHARACTER.
IT HAS SOME KIND OF  LITTLE CURLICUE THERE  
 WHERE THAT ROCK STICKS UP,  
 AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET  THAT CURLICUE,  
 AND YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED  TILL YOU GET IT.
THERE'S A RAPPORT  BETWEEN MY IMAGE  
 AND THAT REAL THING  OUT THERE.
THEY ANSWER TO ONE ANOTHER.
I GET VERY POSSESSIVE   OF MY PLACES,  
 AND I DON'T WANT  ANY OTHER ARTISTS  
 COMING AROUND HERE  AND MESSING AROUND  
 AND PAINTING MY PLACES,  
 OR PHOTOGRAPHERS  
 OR ANY OTHER KIND  OF IMAGE MAKER.
I WANT IT TO MYSELF.
AS YOU STAY THERE LONGER,  YOU DISCOVER MORE.
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY LEARNING  FROM THE SITE YOU'VE CHOSEN,  
 AND I OFTEN FEEL  THAT I COULD GO ON  
 WORKING ON A PAINTING  ALMOST INDEFINITELY.
TOWARDS THE END OF A PAINTING,  YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AROUND.
YOU SAY, "NOW, I WONDER  WHY I DIDN'T STAND OVER THERE,"  
 OR "WHY DID I STAND IN POINT 'A'  INSTEAD OF POINT 'B'?"
[ laughs ]  AND YOU THINK,  
 "THAT WOULD HAVE MADE  A TERRIFIC ONE TOO  
 "FROM OVER HERE,  
 "BUT I'VE KIND OF  I'M DONE HERE.
I'M FINISHED.
I WANT TO MOVE ON."
WHEN I LEFT MAINE,  IT WAS AN EMOTION  
 VERY MUCH LIKE THAT  THAT'S MADE ME DO IT.
I WAS PAINTING A LINE OF HILLS,  AND MY HAND SAID TO ME,  
 "GET OUT OF HERE.
"DON'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
"YOU'VE MADE THAT LINE OF HILLS  SO MANY TIMES.
YOU NEED TO GO  SOMEWHERE ELSE."
AND I PUT MY HOUSE  UP FOR SALE THAT DAY.
WELL, ONE OF MY FAVORITE  WRITERS ON PAINTING  
 SAID THAT A LANDSCAPE ARTIST  
 SEEMS TO HAVE TO MOVE  TO A NEW LOCATION  
 IN ORDER TO REINVENT HIMSELF,  
 AND I THINK  THERE'S SOME TRUTH THERE.
I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF  AS BEING A LANDSCAPE PAINTER.
IN THE POPULAR ENVISIONING  OF THAT TERM,  
 A LANDSCAPE CONSISTS OF  A PAINTING WITH A FLD  
 AND A POND AND A TREE  AND A MOUNTAIN IN THE DISTANCE,  
 ET CETERA, ET CETERA.
IT'S A SORT OF RECIPE THING.
I HOPE VERY MUCH  THAT MY PAINTINGS  
 DON'T LOOK LIKE  RECIPE PAINTINGS,  
 THAT I'VE GONE TO OTHER PLACES  AND SEEN SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
I LIKE TO SAY  I PAINT MY ENVIRONMENT,  
 MY SURROUNDINGS.
IT GIVES YOU THE IDEA  
 THAT IT IS A PHYSICAL THING  THAT SURROUNDS YOU,  
 AND IT DOES.
IT TAKES IT IMMEDIATELY AWAY  
 FROM THE FLAT PLANE IMAGE  OF THE WORLD.
SURROUNDINGS IMPLIES  THAT THE LANDSCAPE  
 DOES REALLY CURVE AROUND YOU,  
 BECAUSE I FOLLOW THE CURVE  THAT I SEE THE CURVE  
 ALSO EXPRESSED THIS WAY  ON THE CANVAS.
AND IF YOU'RE STANDING  ON A HIGH HILL,  
 AND YOU LOOK AT  A STRAIGHT ROAD DOWN HERE  
 IN THE FOREGROUND  OF YOUR PAINTING DOWN BELOW,  
 IT'LL TEND  TO CURVE UP LIKE THIS,  
 AND THE HORIZON  WILL CURVE DOWN LIKE THIS,  
 SO YOU GET THIS SORT OF  ALMOND-SHAPED COMPOSITION  
 THAT DOES REPEAT ITSELF  IN MY PAINTINGS.
THAT WHOLE IDEA  OF THE WANDERING EYE  
 POPPED INTO MY HEAD  BACK THEN,  
 THAT YOU DON'T SEE AN IMAGE  ALL AT ONCE.
YOU SEE IT PART BY PART.
IT UNFOLDS.
THE FIRST PAINTING  I DID LIKE THAT  
 WAS OF  THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM  
 BEFORE THEY BUILT  THE BIG DOME THERE.
I THOUGHT, "IF I STAND HERE  
 "AND PAINT  THAT MARVELOUS THING THERE  
 "AGAINST THE LIGHT,  
 "YOU CAN'T SEE  THAT IT'S RED, REALLY.
IT JUST IS A DARKNESS.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS."
AND THEN I LOOKED  TO THE LEFT AND DOWN THE STREET,  
 81ST STREET, I THINK,  
 AND THEN DOWN THE AVENUE,  WHICH IS COLUMBUS, MAYBE.
I'M TURNING MY HEAD  NEARLY 180 DEGREES  
 SO THAT YOU REALLY  HAVE GONE A LONG WAY.
YOU'VE GONE THE WHOLE WAY  THROUGH THE BUILDING,  
 AND YOU'VE ARRIVED  AT THIS VISTA,  
 AND THEN YOU'VE ARRIVED  AT THE OPPOSITE VISTA  
 IN THE OTHER END  OF THE PAINTING.
PERSPECTIVE IS NOT  WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN.
THAT IS FOR SURE.
I WENT OUT INTO THE LANDSCAPE  AND STARTED WORKING,  
 BOOM, JUST AS THOUGH I WERE  AN ABSTRACT PAINTER,  
 AND I DIDN'T START OUT  WITH THE IDEA,  
 "WELL, YOU KNOW,  YOUR VANISHING POINT IS HERE,  
 AND YOUR FLANKING TREES  ARE HERE AND HERE."
I DIDN'T CONSTRUCT IT  LIKE THAT AT ALL.
I BEGAN TO FIND THAT THINGS  THAT PERSPECTIVE TOLD ME  
 DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TRUE  TO MY EYES,  
 AND I'M NOT SURE  WHAT IS TRUE TO MY EYES.
I'M NOT AS SURE  IT'S SOMETHING  
 THAT I CAN REALLY ASCERTAIN  OR WRITE DOWN,  
 BUT I KNOW  THAT EVERYTHING CHANGES  
 AS YOU MAKE THE MINUTEST  MOVEMENT IN YOUR HEAD  
 AND STILL MORE  WHEN YOU TURN YOUR SHOULDERS.
THERE IS NO SOLUTION  
 TO THE REPRESENTATION  OF THE WORLD.
AS SOON AS YOU TAKE  A THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD  
 IN WHICH THERE IS MOVEMENT  
 AND PLACE IT  ON A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE,  
 YOU MOVE INTO THE WORLD  OF METAPHOR, INEVITABLY,  
 AND PERSPECTIVE IS  AN ATTEMPT TO STANDARDIZE  
 THE METAPHOR  OF THE DEPICTION OF SPACE.
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE  THESE PROBLEMS, THOUGH,  
 ARE OF COURSE THE REASON  THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO GO OUT  
 AND DO IT AGAIN.
IT'S ALWAYS ALIVE,  AND I DON'T WANT SOLUTIONS.
THAT WOULD NOT BE  INTERESTING TO ME.
THE PROCESS ITSELF  IS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM,  
 AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.
[ chuckles ]  
 MY FIRST TRIP DOWN HERE,  
 I PASSED  A LITTLE GROUP OF BEEHIVES,  
 AND I LIKED THE WAY  THEY WERE GROUPED  
 IN THIS BIG EMPTY LANDSCAPE.
I JUST PUT THOSE BEEHIVES  IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD,  
 AND I WAS DOWN ON THE RIO GRANDE  
 DRAWING A WATER GAUGE  MEASURING STATION,  
 AND A MAN CAME UP  AND STOOD BEHIND ME  
 AND WATCHED ME DRAW  FOR A LITTLE BIT.
I TURNED AROUND,  AND I SAID,  
 "EXCUSE ME, BUT YOU  DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW  
 "WHO OWNS THOSE BEEHIVES  UP THE CASA PIEDRA ROAD,  
 DO YOU, BY CHANCE?"
HE SAID,  "YES.
I DO."
WHEN THE SNOW STARTS TO FLY  UP IN COLORADO,  
 HE BRINGS THOSE BEES DOWN HERE  TO THE RIO GRANDE  
 AND SETS THEM UP  IN THESE SMALL GROUPS.
I HAD ABOUT SIX DRAWINGS  OF BEEHIVES  
 I MADE ALL IN ONE DAY.
AND I LOOKED AT THEM,  AND I THOUGHT,  
 "YOU KNOW,  THEY ARE KIND OF FUN.
THEY REALLY ARE."
AND I STARTED COMING  BACK DOWN IN NOVEMBER  
 SO THAT I WOULD HAVE  LONGER TIME  
 WITH THE BEEHIVES STILL THERE.
HE GOT HERE LATE ONE YEAR.
HE PUT THEM ALL  IN THESE ENORMOUS YARDS,  
 ONE IN FRONT OF  A LITTLE MOUNTAIN  
 ON THE SIDE OF THE RIO GRANDE  
 AND ONE OUT  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAIN  
 TOWARDS CANDELARIA.
SO I SAID, "ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA WORK  WITH THESE TWO SITES."
AND THERE WERE  ALL THESE HUNDREDS OF BEEHIVES,  
 AND I GOT GOING ON THEM,  
 AND I GOT THE STRETCHERS BUILT  AND EVERYTHING.
I SAID, "I'LL NEVER FINISH THIS  BEFORE HE MOVES THEM AWAY,  
 SO I'M GONNA  TAKE THESE SKETCHES,"  
 WHICH WERE OIL SKETCHES  FOR THE BIG CANVASES,  
 FINISHED THE SKETCHES UP  LIKE HIGHLY FINISHED PAINTINGS.
SO I ENDED UP WITH  THOSE TWO RATHER SMALL PAINTINGS  
 OF MANY, MANY,  MANY, MANY BEEHIVES.
I PAINTED A POWER PLANT  GENERATING STATION  
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PRAIRIE,  
 AND I WAS STRUCK  BY THIS ENORMOUS LUMP  
 SITTING  IN THIS ENORMOUS FLATSCAPE  
 IN WHICH NOTHING HAPPENED.
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY MILES  AND MILES AND MILES OF NOTHING.
[ laughs ]  AND I THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL.
NOW, THAT WAS  A STRUCTURAL JUXTAPOSITION  
 OF TWO DISPARATE THINGS  SITTING THERE,  
 AND THAT COULD MAKE  A PAINTING.
AS I WORKED ON THAT THING,  
 A LOT OF DETAIL  OF THAT POWER PLANT  
 AND FENCE LINES  AND DITCHES AND ROADS  
 CAME INTO THE PAINTING  BUT VERY MINUTELY.
THE MAIN IMPACT OF THAT PAINTING  IS THIS HUGE LUMP  
 SITTING ON THIS EMPTY TABLETOP  OF PRAIRIE.
AS YOU PAINT, YOU'RE EXPLORING.
"WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE?
WHAT IS THE INTEREST HERE?"
YOU GO TO A PLACE,  
 AND YOU ARE ATTRACTED TO IT  FOR REASON "A,"  
 BUT ONCE YOU START PAINTING,  REASON "A" DISAPPEARS.
SOME FACTORY WORKERS ARE OUT  HAVING A GOOD TIME  
 IN THE EVENING  PLAYING SOFTBALL.
IT'S THE GIRLS' TEAM TONIGHT,  
 AND YOU SAY,  "THIS IS KIND OF NICE.
"THIS IS GOOD  THAT THESE PEOPLE  
 ARE GETTING OUT  AND HAVING A GOOD TIME."
THAT'S THE REASON YOU START,  
 AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE  BECOMES IMPORTANT.
HOW LONG  SHOULD THE SHADOWS BE  
 OF THIS TREE  IN THE LATE AFTERNOON?
HOW DO YOU GET THE SCALE  OF THESE BUILDINGS AROUND HERE  
 TO WORK WITH  THE SCALE OF THE FIGURES?
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
ALL THESE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  COME IN,  
 AND THAT INITIAL IDEA IS  COMPLETELY LOST AND FORGOTTEN,  
 AND YOU'RE INVOLVED  WITH OTHER THINGS.
YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH  THE SOFTNESS OF LIGHT  
 ON THE TALL GRASS  AND THE WAY IT CHANGES  
 WHEN IT GETS TO THE MOWN AREA  OF THE GRASS.
WHY IS IT DOING THAT,  
 AND HOW DO YOU EXPRESS THAT  IN THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR BRUSH?
ALL THESE OTHER THINGS  BECOME IMPORTANT TO YOU,  
 AND THAT OLD THEME,  
 THAT LITERARY THEME THAT  FIRST ATTRACTED YOU IS FINISHED.
IT'S GONE.
I'M INTERESTED IN  BIG OPEN SPACES WHICH ARE EMPTY,  
 EMPTINESS, LIKE THE EMPTINESS  OF THE RACETRACK AREA THERE  
 WITH THOSE SPARSE  SCATTER OF BUILDINGS.
AND THEN THE MARVELOUS  MARKINGS ON THE FLOOR  
 IN THE ARENA  THAT JUDD DISCOVERED,  
 THAT'S LIKE THE TRACKS  ON THE RACETRACK.
I HAD FIRST GOT INTERESTED  IN THOSE MARKINGS  
 ON THE FLOOR  IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.
WHEN I PAINTED, THAT FLOORING  HAD ALL BEEN RIPPED UP  
 'CAUSE THEY WERE VACATED SPACES.
ON THAT FLOOR, YOU SAW  ALL THESE WONDERFUL SCRATCHES  
 AND MARKINGS AND STAINS.
THE HISTORY OF THAT FLOOR  
 IS JUST WRITTEN VERY RICHLY  ALL OVER THERE,  
 AND I LIKE THAT HISTORY.
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY SAYING  
 "REVERENCE" FOR THINGS  OUT THERE.
SOMETHING AS ANONYMOUS  AND MINUTE IN A SENSE  
 AND INCONSEQUENTIAL  AS A SCRATCH IS SOMETHING.
IT'S A REAL THING.
IT'S LIKE YOU AND I.
IT'S A PERSONALITY.
[ chuckles ]  
 IT LOOKS EMPTY, BUT IT REALLY  I SEE FULLNESS THERE.
YES.
AND I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE THAT  FULLNESS TOO IN MY PAINTING.
â™ª  â™ª   
 [ birds chirping ]  
 - THE THING THAT BEGAN  TO FASCINATE ME ABOUT PAINTING  
 WAS THAT IT  DIDN'T DEAL WITH TIME  
 IN THE SENSE THAT  ALMOST EVERY OTHER MEDIUM DOES.
YOU COULD TAKE OUT A CAMERA  
 AND TAKE A PICTURE  OF A PAINTING,  
 AND YOU'D HAVE IT ALL THERE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT  WITH ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE.
IF YOU COME  INTO A SCULPTURE GALLERY,  
 YOU CAN WALK AROUND A SCULPTURE  
 BEFORE YOU HAVE TO COME  TO AN OPINION.
PAINTING DOESN'T GIVE YOU  ANY OF THAT TIME.
IT PLANTS ITSELF  IN FRONT OF YOU  
 AND SAYS, "HERE I AM."
PLUNK.
YOU KNOW, YOU GET  IN FRONT OF IT.
YOU LOOK AT IT.
YOU'VE SEEN IT.
I LIVE HERE IN THE COUNTRY,  AND I SEE WONDERFUL SUNLIGHT  
 AND GREAT CLOUD FORMATIONS  
 AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF  ALL THE TIME,  
 FLDS THAT ARE COVERED  WITH A CERTAIN Ã©LOW FLOWER  
 AT ONE MOMENT,  
 BUT I'M NEVER AWARE  OF ANY OF THAT  
 COMING INTO MY ART EVER.
IT MAY, BUT IT DOESN'T COME  IN ANY DIRECT WAY.
RATHER THAN MY INFLUENCE  COMING FROM NATURE,  
 IT COMES FROM CULTURE:  
 THE CULTURE THAT COMES  FROM THE HISTORY OF ART  
 AND THE CULTURE OF OUR TIMES.
I DO A LOT OF WORKS ON PAPER  
 BUILDING UP TO THE IDEA  OF WORK ON CANVAS.
I WANT TO SEE  HOW SOMETHING'S GONNA LOOK,  
 SO IF IT PRESENTS ME  WITH A VISUAL STRUCTURE  
 THAT'S A LITTLE OFF  FROM WHAT I'VE DONE IN THE PAST,  
 THEN THAT GETS  MY CURIOSITY MORE INTERESTED.
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE  JUGGLING AN IDEA  
 AND GOING FROM  YOU DO ONE,  
 AND THEN YOU GO, AND YOU SAY,  "OKAY, THAT'S INTERESTING,  
 BUT WHAT IF I DID IT THIS WAY?"
OR SOMETHING,  
 SO THEY'RE REALLY ALL TRYOUTS.
IN SOME CASES,  ONE IDEA FOLLOWS ANOTHER,  
 AND IN SOME CASES, IT DOESN'T.
WHEN I GET TO ONE  THAT REALLY INTERESTS ME,  
 LIKE THIS ONE, I THINK,  REALLY INTERESTED ME,  
 AND SO I THOUGHT, "OKAY, I'M  GONNA DO A LARGER ONE OF THAT."
I LIKED THE WAY THE LINES  HUNG FROM THE DIAGONAL.
SO THEN I DO IT WITH COLOR  
 SO THAT I CAN GET A SENSE OF,  YOU KNOW, WHAT IT  
 WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE  
 WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE  IF IT WERE DONE THAT WAY.
I ENDED UP NOT BEING  SO CRAZY ABOUT IT IN THE END  
 BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE  THIS BIG DROOPY CURVE.
AS A YOUNG ARTIST,  I WAS VERY CONNECTED  
 TO WHAT WAS GOING ON  AT THE MOMENT IN NEW YORK,  
 THE LATTER PART  OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM,  
 POP ART,  WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED.
IT WAS A TIME TO START OVER,  
 GO BACK TO THE ELEMENTS  OF PAINTING.
IT WAS ALL PART OF WHAT  LATER BECAME MINIMALISM.
IT WAS ALL A KIND OF  A SEEMINGLY SIMPLE, SINGLE IDEA  
 EXPOSED IN A RAW WAY  FOR PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE,  
 AND IT WAS REFRESHING  
 AND GOT RID OF A LOT OF STUFF  THAT NEEDED GETTING RID OF  
 SO THAT YOU COULD BEGIN  START THINGS OVER.
MAYBE ALL GENERATIONS  FEEL LIKE  
 THEY'RE STARTING THINGS OVER  FOR THEMSELVES,  
 BUT THIS WAS REALLY,  I THINK,  
 A PERIOD WHEN IT WAS  CERTAINLY TRUE.
I GOT THIS INVITATION  TO THE BARNETT NEWMAN SHOW  
 IN PHILADELPHIA.
ON THE INVITATION CARD  WAS THIS VERTICAL PCE OF HIS.
ALMOST ALL OF MY WORK  
 HAD BEEN HORIZONTALLY  LEFT- TO RIGHT-READING ART.
I SUDDENLY THOUGHT  IT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING  
 TO WORK ON A VERTICAL PAINTING  THAT YOU CAN'T READ THAT WAY.
IT'S MY THWARTING THE VIEWER  KIND OF IDEA,  
 ME, THE VIEWER.
YOU CAN'T READ  A VERTICAL PAINTING  
 FROM LEFT TO RIGHT,  
 SO THEN HOW DO YOU READ IT?
DO YOU GO UP AND DOWN OR  I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS JUST  A KIND OF SENSE, LIKE,  
 IT WAS SOMETHING  I WANTED TO DEAL WITH.
IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT THAT  I GET THE COLOR JUST RIGHT HERE  
 BECAUSE ALMOST ANYTHING WOULD DO  SO THAT I COULD SEE THE WORK,  
 AND THEN I CAN DECIDE LATER  IF I WANT TO CHANGE THE COLOR.
IF YOU THINK OF THE RINGS  AS BEING TWO CONNECTED COLUMNS,  
 I'M STILL WORKING OFF THAT  IN A WAY,  
 ONLY NOW I'VE BROUGHT THEM BACK  INTO A COMPLETED FORM,  
 TWO VERTICAL LINES GOING UP.
YOU HAVE THEM BENT  INTO A WHEEL.
GET A LITTLE FRESH AIR.
[ exhales sharply ]  
 OKAY.
GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK.
THERE WAS A GROUP OF US  WHO HAD STUDIOS NEAR THE BOWERY.
SYLVIA AND I WERE IN A BUILDING  
 THAT BOB RYMAN WAS IN,  LUCY LIPPARD.
SOL LEWITT  WAS AROUND THE CORNER;  
 EVA HESSE, ACROSS THE STREET.
SO WE WOULD ALL VISIT  EACH OTHER'S STUDIOS.
THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTION THERE.
THERE WERE PEOPLE DOING VIDEOS.
THERE WERE PEOPLE  WHO WERE PERFORMING DANCE,  
 MAKING HAPPENINGS  OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER.
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME  IN THE VISUAL ART SCENE.
THERE WAS SOMETHING EXCITING  GOING ON ALL THE TIME,  
 AND IT WAS CONTAGIOUS.
I LOVED BEING IN NEW YORK CITY.
I LOVED  THE INDUSTRIAL QUALITY OF IT.
I LOVED LOWER MANHATTAN.
THERE WAS JUST A QUALITY  OF BEING THERE AND THE SOUNDS.
I WAS VERY ROMANTICALLY IN LOVE  WITH NEW YORK AT THAT POINT.
YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE  THE LINE A LITTLE STRONGER.
WHETHER YOU RIDE A BUS OR A CAB  OR SUBWAY OR WHATEVER,  
 YOU SEE EVERYTHING  IN BITS AND PCES.
YOU SEE EVERYTHING IN PARTS.
YOU'D SEE BUILDINGS GOING BY,  
 AND YOU'D SEE GAPS  BETWEEN BUILDINGS GOING BY,  
 AND I BECAME VERY INTERESTED  IN THIS IDEA  
 OF PCES OF ARCHITECTURE  
 THAT WERE BOTH SOLID  AND THAT WERE ATMOSPHERIC  
 AND THE IDEA  THAT A SIMILAR FORM...  
 GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY.
ONE WAY COULD BE A GAP  BETWEEN A BUILDING  
 AND ON ANOTHER WAY  COULD BE A BUILDING.
I LIKE SETTING UP  PROBLEMS FOR THE VIEWER  
 AND THAT VIEWER ISN'T  SOMEONE DETACHED FROM ME.
I'M THE VIEWER.
I'M THE FIRST VIEWER.
I LIKE SETTING UP PROBLEMS  
 LIKE HOW DO YOU  VISUALLY DEAL WITH A RING  
 WHEN WHAT'S USUALLY  IN THE CENTER OF A PAINTING  
 IS VERY IMPORTANT?
IT WAS THE IDEA  OF WHAT WAS MISSING  
 THAT'S IN A LOT OF MY WORK.
IT KEEPS COMING BACK  IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER.
BY TAKING AWAY THE CENTER,  
 THAT FORCES THAT VIEWING  A STEP FURTHER.
IT'S LIKE THE MAIN COURSE  ISN'T THERE,  
 AND YOU'RE HAVING TO DEAL  WITH EVERYTHING ROUND  
 WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE  THE MAIN COURSE.
YEAH, THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
[ machinery droning ]  
 YEAH, THE REFLECTED LIGHT  IS PRETTY GOOD HERE.
I THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WAS APPROACHED  ABOUT DOING SOMETHING  
 FOR THE BUFFALO COURTHOUSE.
THE ONLY REASON I CONSIDERED IT  WAS, I COME FROM THAT AREA.
MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD,  
 WE LIVED IN RELATION  TO THE ERIE CANAL.
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE RAILROAD,  
 THE BARGE CANAL  WITH THE TUGBOATS  
 WAS A ROMANTIC ALLUSION I GUESS.
I LIVED SO FAR IN THE COUNTRY.
MY UNCLES WERE ALL FARMERS,  AND I WORKED FOR THEM.
I WAS PUSHED INTO BEING  AN ARTIST BY TEACHERS.
I LIKED TO DRAW, SO THE IDEA  OF ART SCHOOL SEEMED FINE.
AT THAT POINT,  MY IDEA OF ART SCHOOL  
 WAS PROBABLY NORMAN ROCKWELL   SATURDAY EVENING POSTCOVERS.
I DON'T THINK I KNEW  
 THAT THERE WERE  CONTEMPORARY PAINTERS.
I WENT AWAY TO ART SCHOOL,  AND I CHOSE CLEVELAND.
IT SEEMED LIKE  A LITTLE ART FACTORY.
THERE WERE PEOPLE MAKING WEAVING  AND PEOPLE MAKING JEWELRY  
 AND DOING PAINTINGS  AND ILLUSTRATION,  
 SO I THOUGHT,  "THIS LOOKS GOOD TO ME."
SO THE ENTRANCE IS OVER THERE.
THAT'S THE MAIN ENTRANCE.
- RIGHT, PEOPLE  PEOPLE COME IN THIS WAY,  
 AND THEN THEY TURN THAT WAY  TO GO INTO THE COURTHOUSE,  
 OR THEY CAN COME  
 - THE BUILDING WASN'T BUILT YET.
I JUST HAD PLANS IN FRONT OF ME.
IT'S LIKE WORKING BLIND.
FOR SOMEONE  WHO LIKES TO HAVE  
 MORE CONTROL  OVER WHAT HE'S DOING,  
 IT'S LIKE TAKING A CHANCE  ON SOMETHING.
IT'S TRICKY.
MY IDEA WAS THAT  
 IF THIS WALL BECAME  A TRANSITION  
 BETWEEN THIS ENTRYWAY  AND THE COURTHOUSE ITSELF,  
 WHICH WAS VERY FORMIDABLE  AND VERY BIG,  
 IF, IN FACT, THIS WALL COULD  BECOME A REALLY BEAUTIFUL THING,  
 IT WOULD BE A NICE EXPERIENCE  
 GOING FROM THE ONE BUILDING  TO THE OTHER.
I'M NOT A PERSON  WHO DOES STAINED GLASS A LOT.
IT'S KIND OF TRICKY  
 UNDERSTANDING THAT  YOU'RE DEALING WITH LIGHT  
 IN A WAY THAT IS  TOTALLY DEPENDENT  
 ON THE WORLD YOU'RE SITUATED IN  
 AND THE TIME OF YEAR  AND THE TIME OF DAY AND SO ON.
IT SEEMED LIKE AN AREA  THAT WOULD REALLY WORK OUT  
 FOR THESE TALL COLUMN IDEAS  
 THAT I WAS WORKING ON  AT THAT TIME.
IT WAS A CONTINUATION  OF WHAT I WAS DOING  
 IN MY PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS  OF 2004 WHEN THIS ALL BEGAN.
I WANTED THIS TO BE  BOTH INSIDE THE PAVILION  
 AND OUTSIDE THE PAVILION,  
 A KIND OF HUMANIST SENSE  OF COLOR AND LIGHT  
 THAT WOULD BE...  
 BEAUTIFUL, YOU KNOW?
IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL.
THE SHOW WAS COMPOSED  OF RING IMAGES  
 AND SPLIT RING IMAGES.
MY TITLES ARE ALWAYS  REDIRECTED INTO THE PAINTING,  
 LIKE SQUARE WITHIN A CIRCLE.
THE REASON I DON'T TITLE THEM  SOMETHING MORE POINTED  
 IS THAT I WOULD RATHER  LEAVE THAT BOOK OPEN.
THE MAJORITY OF MY PAINTINGS  HAVE DEALT WITH  
 THE CURVING LINE,  THE ELLIPTICAL LINE,  
 THE OVOID, THE CIRCLE  IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
IT'S THE SAME ELEMENTS JUGGLED  IN A MORE COMPLICATED WAY.
IT'S LIKE THE COLUMN PAINTINGS  LED TO THE RING PAINTINGS.
THE RING PAINTINGS  HAVE KIND OF LED ME TO THIS.
IT'S A WAY OF TAKING  THE IDEA ANOTHER PLACE  
 AND SEEING WHAT'LL HAPPEN.
I'M A ROMANTIC ARTIST,  
 AND I THINK ROMANTICISM  BY NATURE IMPLIES SOMETHING  
 THAT TAKES IT BEYOND  A FORMAL IDEA.
SOMETIMES, I THINK,  "OH, BOB.
YOU'RE JUST A DAMN FORMALIST."
BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER TIMES  
 WHEN I ARGUE WITH MYSELF  ABOUT THAT.
â™ª  â™ª   
 - THIS IS A PROJECT  I'M WORKING ON  
 FOR THE HIGH LINE.
IT WAS SCHEDULED  TO BE DEMOLITIONED.
PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD  ENDED UP SUING THE CITY  
 TO KEEP IT AND MAKE IT A PARK.
I REALLY LIKE THIS IDEA  THAT NATURAL WILDLIFE  
 SURVIVES  IN THIS INTENSE METROPOLIS.
THEY DIDN'T CHANGE  THE SPACE THAT MUCH.
THEY REALLY JUST FRAMED  THE WILDLIFE  
 THAT GREW THERE NATURALLY  OVER THE YEARS.
THE PCE THAT I CONCEIVED  WAS A KIND OF HABITAT.
YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE BIRDS,  BUTTERFLIES, INSECTS THERE,  
 AND I WANTED TO MAKE A LOCATION  
 WHERE YOU WOULD OBSERVE THEM  ON THE HIGH LINE.
I DID TONS OF RESEARCH.
THE PLACE THAT I REALLY LIKED  WORKING WITH  
 IS THE CORNELL ORNITHOLOGY LAB.
THEY DO THESE INCREDIBLE  URBAN WILDLIFE PROJECTS,  
 AND THEY WERE REALLY HELPFUL  
 TO TALK ABOUT  HOW THIS WOULD WORK  
 AND WHAT WOULD COME TO IT,  WHAT MIGHT NOT COME TO IT.
THEY'RE REALLY  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  
 HOW TO GET SOMEONE TO LOOK  AND OBSERVE FOR TEN MINUTES,  
 AND THEY HAD SAID, YOU KNOW,  "TEN MINUTES OF OBSERVATION  
 IS AN INCREDIBLY LONG TIME  FOR A PERSON,"  
 AND THIS IDEA OF SLOWING DOWN  AND REALLY OBSERVING,  
 I THINK IT'S  A REALLY INTERESTING IDEA  
 ALSO FOR VISUAL ART.
WE'RE DEALING WITH NATURE.
WE DON'T KNOW  WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
WILL THE BIRDS NEST THERE,  OR WILL THEY NOT?
LET'S SAY NOTHING HAPPENS.
IT NEEDED TO BE  INTERESTING AS A SCULPTURE.
THE THING THAT MADE ME  INTERESTED IN THE PCE  
 AS A SCULPTURE  WAS THIS IDEA  
 THAT I'M GONNA PUT THE SCULPTURE  IN A LOCATION  
 WHERE YOU HAVE TO  WALK THROUGH IT.
THE WALK ITSELF  BECOMES LIKE A NEGATIVE SPACE  
 IN THE SCULPTURE  AND THAT YOU HAVE THIS  
 THIS VERY DYNAMIC  EXPERIENCE OF IT,  
 AND THAT YOU SEE IT  FROM FAR AWAY,  
 AND THEN IN PERSPECTIVE,  IT GROWS,  
 AND THEN YOU ACTUALLY ARE  IN THE INTERIOR OF IT,  
 AND THEN YOU EXIT.
I THINK THE HIGH LINE  IS VERY BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED.
THERE ARE ALL THESE  DIFFERENT AREAS  
 WHERE YOU CAN STOP AND LOOK,  AND IT FRAMES THE CITY.
AND I WAS THINKING  IT SHOULD BE METAL  
 LIKE IT'S LIKE A LITTLE  IT'S ALMOST LIKE A PETRI DISH.
THIS IS A ONE-TO-ONE SCALE MODEL  OF WHAT I'LL HAVE FABRICATED.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE PCES FEEL  AS IF THEY'RE PUT TOGETHER  
 INTUITIVELY BY HAND  IN THE MOMENT,  
 SO IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BUILD  SOMETHING IN THE STUDIO  
 WHERE I COULD START FEELING,  "THIS NEEDS TO BE MORE DENSE,  
 THE SIZE NEED TO GROW,"  AND PLAY AROU  
 HAVE THE IDEA OF PLAY  AND FLEXIBILITY IN THE MAKING.
ONE THING THAT WAS INTERESTING  ABOUT THIS PROJECT FOR ME  
 WAS THAT IT WAS  VERY HARD TO DRAW.
I DID ALL OF THESE  DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS IDEA  
 OF BEING SPLIT DOWN THE CENTER,  
 TO FIGURE OUT IN SPACE  HOW THIS WOULD WORK  
 BECAUSE THE PROMENADE  CUTS THE PCE IN HALF,  
 AND THIS IS THE ONE  THAT I CHOSE,  
 PARTIALLY BECAUSE IT HAS  
 THIS SPIRALING UP  THAT'S SURPRISING.
THERE'S A BALL  THAT ACTUALLY FITS.
YOU CAN USE THIS.
THE NEGATIVE SPACE  IS ACTUALLY ROUND,  
 AND YOU DON'T REALLY REALIZE IT  UNTIL YOU GET INTO IT,  
 SO IT WAS BUILT AROUND A BALL.
THIS IS A REALLY SIMPLE JIG  TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT  
 A VERY COMPLEX EQUATION,  
 WHICH IS HOW DOES  HOW DOES THIS NEG  
 IF WE WANT TO CARVE OUT A BALL,  HOW DO YOU DO IT?
SO THIS IS JUST  THIS IS JUST THE RADIUS,  
 BUT IT'S THE RADIUS  AT ANY ANGLE.
THERE IS A CENTER OF THE PCE,  KIND OF A PALLADIAN IDEA.
EVEN IF YOU DON'T  CONSCIOUSLY REALIZE YOU'RE IN  
 YOU'RE IN A NEGATIVE SPACE  OF A BALL,  
 AND IT HAS THIS KIND OF SENSE  OF BEING SURROUNDED.
PORTABLE PLANETARIUM  WAS A PCE I DID  
 THAT ACTUALLY WAS THE ORB,  
 AND IT WAS SCALED  VERY MUCH TO THIS IDEA  
 THAT YOU SAW IT AS AN ORB,  
 AND AS YOU GOT  CLOSER AND CLOSER,  
 YOU MOVED IN,  AND YOU WERE SURROUNDED,  
 SO YOU WENT FROM SEEING IT  AS AN EXTERIOR  
 TO BEING IN ITS INTERIOR.
I'LL PHOTOGRAPH THIS PCE  OVER AND OVER.
ONE OF THE IDEAS I HAD  ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY  
 IN RELATIONSHIP  TO THE SCULPTURE  
 WAS THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS REALLY  BECOME THE MEMORY OF THE PCE.
I'M TRYING NOT  TO JUST DOCUMENT THEM  
 BUT TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO  IN A PHOTOGRAPH  
 THAT TELLS US  SOMETHING DIFFERENT  
 OR EMPHASIZES WHAT'S SORT OF  ESSENTIAL ABOUT THE PCE.
THIS PCE IS PLAYING  WITH ONE-POINT PERSPECTIVE  
 TO REPRESENT, TO TRICK OUR EYES  INTO SEEING DEEP SPACE,  
 SO IT'S KIND OF ABSURD  
 TO ACTUALLY USE THAT TRICK  IN REAL SPACE,  
 BUT THEN IT'S INTERESTING  TO PHOTOGRAPH,  
 THEN FLATTEN IT OUT AGAIN.
FOR ME, IT BECOMES MORE LIKE  A RUSSIAN CONSTRUCTIVIST DRAWING  
 OR A FUTURIST PAINTING  
 IN THAT, IT'S DESCRIBING  SPEED AND MOVEMENT  
 BUT ENTIRELY  ON A FLAT, STILL PLANE.
IT'S ALSO FUNNY  BECAUSE THESE ALMOST BECOME  
 COMPUTER IMAGES  WHEN THEY'RE FLATTENED OUT.
THEY'RE SO CRISP, RIGHT?
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO EXACTLY  IN PERSPECTIVE, ACTUALLY.
[ grinder buzzes ]  
 [ welding torch crackling ]  
 THERE'S THIS  KIND OF SCAFFOLDING  
 THAT'S GONNA BE  THE BASE OF THE PCE.
THEN THERE ARE THESE ELEMENTS  
 THAT EACH HAVE  A DIFFERENT FUNCTION,  
 THERE'S WATER,  HOUSING, AND FOOD,  
 AND THERE ARE THESE  DIFFERENT LOCATIONS,  
 AND THEY'RE BASED  PARTIALLY AESTHETICALLY  
 AND PARTIALLY ON RESEARCH  AND PRACTICAL NEED  
 FOR HOW THIS MIGHT WORK.
ORIGINALLY,  I BUILT THESE STRINGS  
 AS A JIG TO MEASURE.
RIGHT NOW,  ALL OF THESE BOXES ALIGNED  
 SHOULD BE PARALLEL  ON THE SIDES TO THESE STRINGS.
ALL OF THE FRONTS  AND THE BACKS  
 SHOULD BE PARALLEL  TO THE BLUE TAPE.
AFTER I BUILT IT, I THOUGHT,  "I LIKE THIS LANGUAGE."
YOU FEEL  THE ACTUAL THINKING PROCESS  
 OF TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM.
THIS STRING SYSTEM  WAS, IN AND OF ITSELF,  
 AESTHETICALLY VERY INTERESTING,  
 SO THEN THIS IS GONNA BECOME  PART OF THE PCE.
I WAS THINKING  IT SHOULD BE METAL.
- SWIVEL DOWN  
 - THESE CLAMPS MAY BE  COMPLETELY DECORATIVE.
THEY MAY NOT BE DOING  ANYTHING,  
 BUT THEY SIGNIFY  A KIND OF FLEXIBILITY.
- TO MAKE THE RIGHT ANGLE.
I MEAN, THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,  THIS IS GONNA  
 [ grinder buzzes ]  
 [ drill whirring ]  
 - SCALE IS CRUCIAL  WHEN YOU'RE WORKING OUTDOORS,  
 ESPECIALLY WHEN  YOU'RE IN MANHATTAN.
THE SPECTACLE OF SPACE,  OF SCALE, OF INFORMATION  
 IS SO HIGH  THAT THE SIZE IS CRUCIAL.
I'M INTERESTED  TO TAKE A PUBLIC PCE  
 AND HAVE IT FEEL INTIMATE,  
 AND THEN WHEN YOU GET THERE,  
 YOU FEEL SLIGHTLY EMBRACED  BY THE PCE ITSELF,  
 SLIGHTLY NESTED, WHICH PLAYS  ON THE IDEA OF THE HABITAT.
I'M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT  HOW THE FRAME CAN BLEED OUT  
 INTO THE LOCATION.
ONE OF THE IDEAS IN THIS PCE  THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S OUTDOORS,  
 IT STILL HAS THIS QUALITY  THAT IT'S MUTABLE,  
 CHANGEABLE, THAT YOU  COULD COME BACK IN A WEEK,  
 AND IT WOULD BE  CONFIGURED DIFFERENTLY.
THIS IS CORRECT,  AND THAT'S CORRECT,  
 AND THAT'S CORRECT  FOR WHAT I HAVE.
[ power tools whirring ]  
 I STUDIED ARCHITECTURE  AND PAINTING,  
 SO I CAME TO SCULPTURE  FROM THOSE DISCIPLINES.
I'M ALWAYS THINKING,  
 "WHAT CAN YOU DO IN A SCULPTURE  THAT YOU CAN'T DO IN A DRAWING?
WHAT CAN YOU DO IN A BUILDING  THAT YOU CAN'T DO IN A PRINT?"
MY FATHER IS AN ARCHITECT,  SO I GREW UP AROUND  
 MODELS, PLANS,  LOOKING AT CONSTRUCTION SITES,  
 AND ALSO WITH HIS EYE  OF JUST ALWAYS TALKING  
 ABOUT BUILDINGS AND CITIES.
THAT LOOKS GOOD.
YEAH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.
THAT ONE LOOKS RIGHT.
THIS ONE LOOKS WRONG,  BUT, I MEAN,  
 THAT'S THE ONE  THAT I MADE UP, SO...  
 [ drill whirring ]  
 YEAH, 'CAUSE IT  THAT CREATES, LIKE, A...  
 [ imitates ticking ]  
 A RHYTHM FROM THERE  TO THERE TO THERE.
IT'S GOOD.
[ power tools whirring ]  
 MY WHOLE BODY OF WORK  
 HAS THIS KIND OF FLEXIBLE,  MUTABLE QUALITY.
IT HAS THE RAWNESS OF A STUDIO  OR THE RAWNESS OF A LABORATORY  
 WHERE THINGS COULD HAPPEN  OR THINGS COULD FALL APART.
I THINK ABOUT  THE FIRST VIEW OF A PCE  
 BEING LIKE THE FIRST LINE  IN A NOVEL.
WHEN YOU LEAVE,  
 WHAT'S THE LAST PART  OF THE NOVEL?
WHERE DO YOU MAINTAIN  YOUR VIEWER'S INTEREST?
WHERE DO YOU CHALLENGE THEM?
WHERE'S THE CATHARSIS?
SO THAT IT IS REALLY  A KIND OF NARRATIVE STORY  
 OF MOVEMENT THROUGH SPACE.
I TALK ABOUT THE IDEA  OF CHOREOGRAPHED EXPERIENCE  
 OF THE VIEWER  THROUGH THE SPACE.
YOU BECOME AWARE OF YOUR BODY  IN RELATION TO THE WORK.
ONE OF THE IDEAS  FROM THE VERY BEGINNING  
 IN TERMS OF THE MATERIALS I USE  WAS ACCESSIBILITY.
A LOT OF THE MATERIALS  
 WERE THINGS THAT YOU COULD GET  AT A DOLLAR STORE.
THEY'RE VERY GENERIC.
THE CULTURAL VALUE,  THE MONETARY VALUE  
 WOULD BE VERY LOW,  
 AND THEN PUT THEM  IN A LOCATION  
 WHERE THAT BECAME VERY HIGH.
SO THE SHIFTS IN SCALE  WERE REALLY INTERESTING TO ME,  
 LITERALLY, IN TERMS OF SPACE,  
 BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF  THE PROFOUND AND THE MUNDANE,  
 THE FLEETING AND THE PERMANENT,  
 A PCE THAT'S ALWAYS TEETERING.
TOKYOWAS A VERY HARD PCE  TO PHOTOGRAPH, FILM.
IT'SYOU HAVE TO SEE IT  IN PERSON, REALLY.
SOME OF MY WORK  IS REALLY ABOUT  
 USING SPACES THAT GO UNNOTICED  OR UNOCCUPIED.
IN A MUSEUM  THAT'S DESIGNED TO SEE WORK,  
 TO THEN PUT IT  IN A PLACE  
 LIKE THE VENTILATION  BY THE WINDOW  
 IS KIND OF A NICE OPPORTUNITY.
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE  THE EXPERIENCE OF VIEWING  
 TO BE ONE OF DISCOVERY,  
 THAT YOU DON'T WALK IN,  SOMETHING IS PRESENTED,  
 AND IT'S FRAMED,  AND IT SAYS,  
 "THIS IS IMPORTANT;  I'M ART."
OFTEN, WITH MY WORK,  IT'LL BE IN A CORNER,  
 OR IT'LL BE BEHIND A STAIR.
IT'LL BE NEAR  THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR  
 SO THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE  OF FIRST IS, "WHAT IS THIS?"
FOR ME, MOST INTERESTING ART  ALWAYS HAS THAT QUESTION IN IT.
IT ALWAYS QUESTIONS  WHAT ART IS.
[ crowd chattering ]  
 - ARE WE TRYING TO GET  THE BIRDS TO COME?
- I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S ASK.
- WHAT ARE  WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
- WELL, IT'S AN ARTWORK,  BUT IT'S ALSO A BIRD FEEDER  
 AND A BIRD HABITAT.
- AND BIRDS EAT ORANGES?
- YES, ORIOLES EAT ORANGES.
YEP.
- VERY INTERESTING.
- YEP.
AND BUTTERFLIES AND BEES TOO.
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PCE,  
 BUT I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND  THE FRUIT ON IT.
WELL, IT'S A SCULPTURE WORK,  BUT IT'S A BIRD HABITAT.
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU.
IT'S FOR THE BIRDS.
- FOR THE BIRDS.
[ both laugh ]  
 - SOMEBODY'S PUT  THEIR OWN SEEDS IN,  
 'CAUSE WE DON'T USE THESE SEEDS.
ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT HAPPENS  
 IN MY PCES THAT AREN'T  
 HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH  LEAVING THINGS OR FOR BIRDS,  
 BUT IS THAT PEOPLE, ACTUALLY,  IN MUSEUMS WILL LEAVE  
 OBJECTS FROM THEIR POCKETS  IN THE PCE.
- AND PUT MORE WATER.
- YEAH.
- AND WHO'S THE ARTIST?
WHO DID THAT?
- I'M THE ARTIST.
- OH, YOU'RE THE ARTIST.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
C'EST LA DAME ACTUELLE   QUI TU FAIT.
- FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT,  
 I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH ON BIRDS  AND WHAT BIRDS LIKE  
 AND WHAT COULD  DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS  
 COULD ATTRACT  DIFFERENT KIND OF BIRDS.
- WHICH BIRDS  ARE YOU ATTRACTING IN HERE?
- WELL, THESE ONES ARE  THIS IS SORT OF THE  
 IT'S A VERY GOOD  BASIC BIRD SEED JUST TO USE.
- USE FOR ANY BIRD?
- YEAH.
- AND IS IT GOING  TO STAY FOR A LONG TIME?
- ONE YEAR.
YEAH.
- ONE YEAR.
WOW.
SO THAT IS DOING AN EXPERIMENT  AT THE SAME TIME?
- EXACTLY.
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
IT'S AN EXPERIMENT.
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.
- AU REVOIR.
- AU REVOIR.
- SAY TRES BON.
- TRES BON.
- MERCI.
- IT LOOKS LIKE A BIRDHOUSE.
- CUTE.
- DISCOVERED A NEW USE  FOR ORANGES:  
 WIPING AWAY BIRD POOP.
[ laughs ]  
 THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
HOW DID I MAKE IT?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
SO WHAT I DID WAS,  I MADE THE ENTIRE THING  
 IN A MODEL,  SO ALL OF THIS I MADE IN WOOD,  
 AND THESE WERE ALL  MADE IN CARDBOARD,  
 AND WE USEDWE PUT  WE PUT ALL OF THESE STRINGS HERE  
 AS A GUIDE  SO WE COULD FIGURE OUT  
 ONE-POINT PERSPECTIVE.
SEE ALL THESEE?
THEY'VE BEEN EATING LIKE CRAZY,  AND WE'VE BEEN REFILLING THEM,  
 AND THEY ALSO COME  FOR THE WATER TOO.
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT  EVERY SEASON.
- COOL.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU PUT ORANGES THERE,  YOU'LL GET BALTIMORE ORIOLES.
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE  THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING.
I HEARD THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH  IN BROOKLYN, BUT NOT  
 THEY DON'T USUALLY HAVE THEM  ON THE HIGH LINE,  
 BUT THERETHERE'S ORANGES,  AND THERE'S APPLES.
- OH.
- ALSO, IT'S JUST  NICE FOR COLOR.
- THANKS.
- OH, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE  FLYING IN.
THERE YOU GO.
THEY'RE INTERESTED.
THEY ASK QUESTIONS.
IT JUST BLENDS IN  WITH THE ENVIRONMENT,  
 BLENDS IN WITH THE PATHWAY.
THEY'RE NOT QUESTIONING  WHY IT'S THERE  
 IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU  OFTEN HAVE WITH PUBLIC ART.
YOU KNOW?
THAT'S GOOD.
[ laughs ]  
 - I LOVE BUMBLEBEES!
'CAUSE I SAW THEM!
