 - I FIGURED OUT THAT ART WOULD  BE THE PERFECT PLACE FOR ME  
 BECAUSE WHAT'S ENCOURAGED  IS THE INVENTION OF LANGUAGES.
- MY GENERATION SEEMS TO STAND  ON UNSTABLE GROUND,  
 AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN MY WORK  IN VARIOUS, DIFFERENT WAYS.
- YOU SHOULD EXPRESS YOURSELF  THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO BE.
GAY POLITICS,  HUMAN RIGHT POLITICS, WHATEVER,  
 IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT BEING FREE.
- THESE IDEAS HAVE COME  FROM, REALLY, PAINTING IDEAS,  
 YET THEY'RE DIMENSIONAL.
[ saw buzzing ]  
 - [ clicking tongue ]  
 I DON'T NEED TO MAKE SKETCHES  OF THE SCULPTURES I MAKE  
 BECAUSE I DON'T THINK  THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE  
 BETWEEN PUTTING INK  ON A PCE OF PAPER  
 AND GLUING LITTLE PCES  OF CRYSTAL  
 ON PLEXIGLAS IN SPACE.
I DON'T DO DRAWINGS,  
 BECAUSE I HAVE OTHER MATERIALS  THAT I FIND INTERESTING.
95% OF THE RELATIONSHIP  I HAVE TO MY WORK  
 IS THROUGH PROCESS.
IT'S NOT AS A DISTANT OBJECT.
IT'S A MADE OBJECT.
I LIKE THE IDEA  OF TRUSTING THE WORK,  
 TRUSTING THE MATERIAL,  AND TRUSTING  
 THAT EVERY LITTLE STEP  IS GONNA DICTATE THE NEXT ONE.
I HAVE TO GIVE IT A STRUCTURE.
THAT'S ON ME.
BUT THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT,  
 THE MATERIAL BEHAVES  IN SUCH UNPREDICTABLE WAYS  
 THAT I FIND BEAUTIFUL.
[ sighs ]  
 I'M INTERESTED IN SCIENCE  
 THE SAME WAY I'M INTERESTED  IN ART,  
 WITH A SORT OF CHILDLIKE  FASCINATION.
I REALIZED VERY EARLY  IN MY STUDIES IN SCIENCE  
 THAT I WASN'T INTERESTED  IN LEARNING A LANGUAGE.
I WAS REALLY INTERESTED  IN INVENTING LANGUAGES.
I FIGURED OUT THAT ART WOULD BE  THE PERFECT PLACE FOR ME  
 BECAUSE WHAT'S ENCOURAGED  IS THE INVENTION OF LANGUAGES.
EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID  AND WAS MAKING DRAWING,  
 WHAT I FOUND FASCINATING  IS THAT I WAS ABLE  
 TO MAKE WHATEVER I WANT  EXIST IN THIS WORLD  
 AND HAVE PEOPLE REACT TO IT.
I'VE ALWAYS FELT DIFFERENT,  I MEAN, FOR MANY REASONS.
MY FATHER COMES  FROM EASTERN EUROPE,  
 I'M JEWISH, AND I'M GAY.
BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG  AND YOU REALIZE  
 THAT YOU HAVE AN EASE  AT SOMETHING  
 OR A TALENT FOR SOMETHING,  
 IT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE.
IT'S MINTY.
IT SMELLS LIKE MINT.
IT'S TRUE, BECAUSE THEY USE  THAT'S WHAT THEY USE  
 AT THE DENTIST TO TAKE  THE IMPRINT OF YOUR  
 IT'S NOT TOXIC, YOU KNOW?
[ exhales ]  
 WHEN I MAKE A SCULPTURE,  I DEAL WITH THE MATERIAL FIRST.
THEN I TRY TO INJECT  MY SENSIBILITY IN IT.
I TRY TO GIVE A CERTAIN FLAVOR  TO THE SCULPTURE.
THAT'S HOW I MAKE COLOR CHOICES,  FOR EXAMPLE.
I SEE THE IMPORTANCE  OF THE CHOICE OF COLORS  
 AS CHANGING EVERYTHING  INSIDE THE SCULPTURE.
I'M EXTREMELY ATTRACTED  TO PASTEL COLORS,  
 BUT THEY HAVE TO BE  DIRTY IN SOME WAY.
I LIKE THE COMBINATION  OF LAVENDER AND PINK  
 AND MAYBE MINT GREEN,  
 BUT THEN THERE HAS TO BE  
 SOME KIND OF DIRTY BROWN  GREEN IN IT...  
 JUST TO KIND OF INFECT  THE PRETTINESS.
THEN I FEEL LIKE I'VE FOUND  EXACTLY THE RIGHT BALANCE.
I DON'T WANT THE SCULPTURE  THAT I MAKE  
 TO BE A MERE ILLUSTRATION.
I TRY TO BUILD AN OBJECT  
 THAT'S GONNA BECOME COMPLEX  ENOUGH, HAVE ENOUGH LAYERS,  
 HAVE ENOUGH REFERENCES  AND ENERGY  
 TO START FEELING  LIKE IT'S ALIVE...  
 THAT IT'S DEVELOPING  THE CAPACITY  
 OF GENERATING ITS OWN MEANING.
AND THEN I CAN LOOK AT IT  FROM A DISTANCE  
 AND LEARN FROM IT,  
 BECAUSE I CAN ALMOST SEE IT SAY  OR HEAR IT SAY  
 THINGS THAT I NEVER THOUGHT.
THESE ARE MEANT  TO RESEMBLE BEES.
ACTUALLY, IN THAT PCE,  
 WHAT I'M GONNA TRY  TO BE DOING IS  
 ACCUMULATE A LOT  OF SMALL ELEMENTS  
 THAT ARE SORT OF REFERENTIAL,  FIGURATIVE ELEMENTS  
 BEES, INSECTS, NEEDLES  
 AND ACCUMULATE THEM TO THE POINT  
 WHERE THAT SWARM  THAT I'M GOING TO CREATE  
 IS GOING TO BECOME  A SORT OF ABSTRACT SHAPE.
SO I WANT TO START  
 BY FIGURATIVE, RECOGNIZABLE,  SMALL, DETAILED ELEMENTS  
 AND COMBINE THEM TO MAKE  SOMETHING THAT BECOMES ABSTRACT.
VERY OFTEN,  IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
THE MORE YOU ZOOM IN,  THE MORE ABSTRACT IT BECOMES.
IN THAT CASE, I WANT TO START  WITH A LARGE ABSTRACT SHAPE,  
 AND WHEN YOU ZOOM IN,  
 YOU ACTUALLY START RECOGNIZING  THINGS MORE AND MORE.
[ train rumbling on tracks ]  
 [ train rumbling on tracks ]  
 WHEN I MAKE SCULPTURE,  WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS  
 MAKE AN OBJECT THAT'S GOING  TO FEEL LIKE IT'S ALIVE.
I'M NOT INTERESTED  IN RE-PRESENTING LIFE.
I'M MORE INTERESTED  IN MAKING OBJECTS  
 THAT SORT OF FUNCTION  LIKE LIVING THINGS,  
 SO THEY'LL FEEL  LIKE THEY'RE ALIVE.
WHEN I PUT MY HANDS ON IT  OR WHEN I MAKE HOLES IN IT  
 AND DRAG PLASTER  THROUGH THAT HOLE,  
 IT'S REALLY TO INJECT  AN ENERGY IN IT.
SO I KIND OF LIKE THAT CONTRAST  
 BETWEEN THE FACT  THAT A HOLE THROUGH THE CHEST  
 MIGHT BE INTERPRETED  AS MEANING DEATH,  
 BUT IN MY MIND,  IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE.
IT SHOULD NOT EVEN,  LIKE, BE FLUSH.
IT SHOULD BE LOWER,  
 BECAUSE, IF YOU CAN IMAGINE,  
 IF I PUT PLASTER ON IT  AND IT'S FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE,  
 THEN ITHAT MEANS THERE WILL BE  SUCH A THIN LAYER OF PLASTER  
 THAT, LIKE, JUST THAT  IS GONNA MAKE IT CRACK.
- YEAH.
- TAKE IT DOWN, LIKE,  AT LEAST 1/8 INCH.
- ALL RIGHT.
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.
- THANKS.
[ scraping sounds ]  
 THIS ONE IS PART OF A SERIES  THAT I STARTED A YEAR AGO  
 CALLED THE WATCHERS.
THE WATCHERSARE SOME KIND  OF ANGEL FIGURES.
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY  WINGED FIGURE,  
 LIKE THE CLICHE OF THE ANGEL,  
 BUT THE EARS HAVE SOMETHING  A LITTLE BIT WINGLIKE.
I'M ALSO INTERESTED  IN OPENINGS, ORIFICES.
A BODY THAT WOULD BE FILLED  WITH ORIFICES  
 THAT USUALLY HAVE THE PURPOSE  OF HEARING SOUND  
 WAS INTERESTING AS WELL.
THE IDEA OF SENSES.
SOMETIMES THEIR BODIES  ARE COVERED IN HANDS;  
 THAT'S THE IDEA OF THE TOUCH.
AND IF THEY'RE COVERED IN EARS,  
 I LIKE THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE  
 BECOME LIKE A BODY THAT WOULD BE  ULTRASENSITIVE WITH SOUND.
[ sighs ]  
 I THINK FASTER THAN I CAN SPEAK.
MY BRAIN IS NOT THE BEST WHEN IT  COMES TO VERBAL LANGUAGE.
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE  I'M VERY COMFORTABLE  
 USING MATTER AND PLACING THINGS.
IT FEELS LIKE MY BRAIN  IS TOTALLY IN SYNC.
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE  THERE'S BRAINS IN MY HANDS.
[ clicking tongue ]  
 THE VESSEL,THERE'S SOMETHING  ALMOST RELIGIOUS ABOUT IT,  
 AND IT'S REALLY MAKING A VERY  STRONG REFERENCE TO THE BODY  
 IN ITS SYMMETRICAL SHAPE.
THE WAY IT'S RADIATING FEELS  ALMOST CATHOLIC IN SOME WAY.
I CAN SEE IT GOING  IN THAT DIRECTION,  
 THE IDEA OF A CENTER OF ENERGY  
 AND RADIATION OF THAT ENERGY  AND THE BODY,  
 SOMETHING THAT WASN'T  AS CLEAR BEFORE IN MY WORK.
BECAUSE OF THE FACT  THAT IT'S NOT SYMMETRICAL,  
 I FEEL LIKE THE SWARM  BECOMES MORE LIKE A LANDSCAPE  
 AND LESS LIKE A BODY.
THAT SHAPE FLOATING IN SPACE  IS VERY SOFT.
THAT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE  A CLOUD SOMEHOW.
BUT THEY'RE, AT THE SAME TIME,  AGGRESSIVE.
EVERY ELEMENT IN THAT SWARM  HAS THE POTENTIAL TO STING YOU.
I FOUND THAT COMBINATION  
 OF THE SOFTNESS  OF THAT ABSTRACT CLOUD SHAPE  
 AND THAT AGGRESSIVE POTENTIAL  TO BE REALLY NICE, THAT BALANCE.
THE VESSELAND THE SWARM  ARE BIG ENOUGH  
 TO BE CONSIDERED  LIKE LABORATORIES  
 INSIDE OF WHICH I TRY THINGS,  I COMBINE MATERIALS IN NEW WAYS,  
 I MAKE MISTAKES,  I COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS.
THE WORK HAS DEVELOPED  ENOUGH COMPLEXITY AND LAYERS  
 AND INTELLIGENCE  AND INDEPENDENCE  
 THAT IT'S ABLE TO GENERATE  ITSELF AND TRANSFORM ITSELF.
- THE JAPANESE PAVILION  HAS A HOLE IN THE CEILING  
 AND A HOLE IN THE FLOOR.
RAIN FALLS THROUGH THE ROOF.
THE CONCEPT IS THAT  WITH THE RAIN FALLING THROUGH,  
 THE BUILDING BECOMES ONE  WITH NATURE.
I DECIDED TO USE THE ENTIRE  BUILDING AS PART OF MY WORK.
[ sustained tone ]  
 [ eerie melody ]  
 â™ª  â™ª   
 THERE IS A CHINESE SAYING:  
 "A FROG IN A WELL  DOES NOT KNOW THE BIG OCEAN."
IN JAPAN, WE LIKE TO SAY,  
 "A FROG IN THE WELL  DOESN'T KNOW THE BIG OCEAN.
HOWEVER, HE KNOWS  THE HEIGHT OF THE SKY."
[ deep orchestral tones ]  
 I PUT MYSELF IN THE SHOES  OF THIS FROG.
THAT'S HOW I CONCEIVED  AND DEVELOPED MY IMAGES.
â™ª  â™ª   
 I LIKE TO MAKE MUSIC  MORE THAN LISTEN TO IT.
I KNOW WHAT KINDS OF SOUNDS  THE WORK NEEDS,  
 AND I CAN MAKE THEM MYSELF.
[ rumbling sounds ]  
 JAPANESE KITCHENWAS MY FIRST  VIDEO INSTALLATION.
I CREATED IT  FOR MY GRADUATION PROJECT.
IN ORDER TO GET MY FIRST JOB  IN THE DESIGN FLD,  
 I PUT ALL MY TECHNIQUE  AND KNOWLEDGE INTO THIS WORK.
[ knife chopping ]  
 [ faucet squeaks ]  
 [ water running ]  
 SALARY MAN, HOUSEWIFE,  OR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT:  
 THEY'RE ALL STEREOTYPICAL  CHARACTERS.
I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN THEM,  
 SO I CAN FOCUS ON CONTENT  RATHER THAN CHARACTER.
[ voice chanting ]  
 [ sizzling ]  
 [ sizzling ]  
 [ motor humming ]  
 MY INSPIRATION IS THE SITUATION  
 OF THE HOUSEWIFE DOING COOKING  AND LISTENING TO THE TV,  
 A KIND OF TALK SHOW TYPE  OF NEWS REPORTING.
YOU MIGHT HEAR SOMETHING PAINFUL  OR HORRIBLE,  
 ONE AFTER ANOTHER,  
 BUT TEN SECONDS AFTER YOU HEAR  THAT HORRIBLE, PAINFUL STORY,  
 YOU'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN IT.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING  IS PREPARING THE DINNER.
[ voice chanting ]  
 [ knife chopping ]  
 [ chanting continues ]  
 SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND IT PAINFUL.
SOME MAY FIND IT FUNNY.
[   water runs   ]  [knob squeaking]  
 WHEN I'M MAKING MY WORK, I TAKE  50% OF THE RESPONSIBILITY.
THE OTHER HALF  OF THE RESPONSIBILITY  
 IS ON THE VIEWER...  
 [ gunshot ]  
 THEN THE WORK IS COMPLETE.
DRAWING IS VERY IMPORTANT.
WITHOUT DRAWING,  MY IDEAS CAN'T PERCOLATE.
I MAKE LINE DRAWINGS ON PAPER,  AND THEN I SCAN THEM  
 AND FILL IN THE LINES  ON THE COMPUTER.
I TAKE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS  I HAVE COLORED IN  
 AND COMBINE THEM ON A SCREEN  TO CREATE A SINGLE IMAGE.
THEN I PUT THE IMAGES  ON A TIMELINE, CEL BY CEL,  
 CREATING THE ANIMATION.
[ distorted electronic music ]  
 â™ª  â™ª   
 GUIGNORAMA IS A VISUALIZATION  OF THE SENSATION I GET  
 FROM THE ATOPIC DERMATITIS  IN MY HANDS.
WHEN MY HANDS ITCH,  
 IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S  AN INSECT OR SOMETHING  
 CRAWLING UNDER MY SKIN.
[ speaking Japanese ]  
 I WANTED THE DRAWINGS  TO CONVEY  
 THE SENSATION OF SOMETHING  LIVING INSIDE MY HANDS,  
 EVEN THOUGH THEY SEEM NORMAL  ON THE SURFACE.
THE WORD "GUIGNORAMA"  IS MY COMBINATION  
 OF THE FRENCH WORD GUIGNOL,  MEANING "PUPPET,"  
 AND THE ENGLISH WORD "PANORAMA."
THIS COMBINATION CONVEYS  A SENSE OF INSTALLATION.
I REALLY LIKE INVENTING WORDS.

 - PUBLIC TOILETS  ARE VERY PUBLIC PLACES,  
 BUT ONCE YOU ENTER A STALL,  
 IT BECOMES AN EXTREMELY  PRIVATE PLACE.
[   water running   ]  [faucet squeaks]  
 [ deep rumbling tone ]  
 WHEN I WAS MAKING THE WORK,  
 I WAS VERY CONSCIOUS  OF THE WORLD OF THE INTERNET.
[ door creaks ]  
 THERE ARE MANY KINDS  OFF COMMUNITIES ON THE INTERNET,  
 DIVIDED ACCORDING  TO THEIR INTERESTS,  
 AS THOUGH EACH IS IN ITS OWN  PRIVATE ROOM OR STALL.
[ deep rumbling tone ]  
 FROM TIME TO TIME, THE CAMERA  AND ITS CLOSE-UP COVERAGE  
 OF WHAT IS GOING ON  
 INTRUDES BY BRINGING THE VIEWER  INTO THAT SPACE.
[ crackling noise ]  
 [ camera shutter clicks ]  
 [ clicking sound ]  
 [ shutter clicking ]  
 THE WORLD OF CONCEALED  INFORMATION  
 WHICH, IN THIS VIDEO,  HAS TO DO WITH THE PRIVACY  
 OF THE BATHROOM STALL AND ITS  PARALLEL IN THE INTERNET  
 IS SOMETHING THAT I KEEP IN MIND  ALL THE TIME.
[ water splashing ]  
 IN PUBLIC CONVENIENCE,  THE WATER IS CONSTANTLY RUNNING.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING.
ITS DESTINATION  IS HIDDEN FROM US,  
 BUT IF A LOT OF WATER  IS COMING IN,  
 IT HAS TO BE GOING SOMEWHERE,  
 SO THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WORLD  THAT LIES BEYOND.
[ water splashes ]  
 [ water gurgling ]  
 IN MY WORK,  THE COMING AND GOING OF WATER  
 IS A WAY OF ENVISIONING  A WORLD BEYOND THIS ONE.

 BUT IMMEDIATELY  PUT IT UP FOR ADOPTION.
I THOUGHT A LOT  ABOUT HER SITUATION,  
 AND I USED THAT IDEA  IN THIS WORK.
[ door creaks ]  
 [ footsteps ]  
 [ toilet flushes ]  
 I WANT THE VIEWER TO ACTIVELY  ENGAGE WITH THE WORK.
I WANT THEM TO WONDER,  
 "WHAT DOES THIS WORK  MEAN TO ME?"
[ shoes clicking ]  
 [ doors creak and shut ]  
 [ camera clicks ]  
 - ALL OF THIS,  THE WORK IN GENERAL,  
 IT'S ABOUT BEING FREE.
YOU SHOULD EXPRESS YOURSELF  THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO BE.
GO AFTER THINGS IN YOUR LIFE  THAT BRING YOU PLEASURE.
GAY POLITICS,  HUMAN RIGHT POLITICS, WHATEVER,  
 IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT BEING FREE.
WE'RE MAKING A SERIES  OF 58 DRAWINGS  
 FOR THIS ART FAIR IN SAO PAULO.
SO THIS WAS MY PROPOSAL EMAIL.
ME AND CHRISTOPHE ARE MAKING  CYCLOPS TRANNIES PORTRAITS.
TRANNIES  TRANSVESTITESPORTRAITS.
- WE HAD THE CONCEPT,  
 "OKAY, LET'S MAKE ALL THESE  PORTRAIT OF CYCLOP TRANNIES."
WE HAD TO WORK SEPARATELY.
ONE OF THESE FEW PROJECT  WHERE, ACTUALLY,  
 I DID 20-SOMETHING DRAWINGS,  
 AND HE DID, LIKE, 20 OTHER,  LIKE, SOMETHING DRAWING.
AND THEN THEY WERE ALL, LIKE,  FRAMED TOGETHER  
 AND DISPLAYED ON THE WALL.
I ALWAYS LIKE THIS THING  OF LEAVING YOUR EGO BEHIND  
 AND MERGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING  QUITE MAGICAL.
I LOVE THIS IDEA  OF COLLABORATION.
IN 2005, WE WERE INVITED  TO BE PART OF THIS BIG SHOW  
 FOR THE L.A. MOCA.
THIS IS THE FIRST EVER PROJECT  THAT WE DID TOGETHER, FULL-ON.
WE CONCEIVE EVERYTHING TOGETHER,  
 SO THAT WAS ALWAYS DRIVEN  BY THIS COLLABORATIVE DYNAMIC.
WE SPENT THREE MONTHS IN L.A.,  
 AND IT WAS ALSO  DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION  
 AND THERE WAS ALL THESE THING  GOING ON WITH SCIENTOLOGY.
AND SO WE DECIDED TO CONNECT  ALL THIS DIFFERENT INFORMATION  
 FOR THAT INSTALLATION.
WE DECIDED TO TURN  ALL OF THE MUSEUM INTO A DISCO  
 AND WANTED THE DISCO TO ACTUALLY  FUNCTION AS A NIGHTCLUB  
 DURING THE COURSE OF THE SHOW.
- THIS DISCO WAS LIKE AN HOMAGE  
 TO THE BIRTH OF GAY RIGHTS  IN AMERICA,  
 WHICH, A LOT OF IT HAPPENED  IN THE DISCO SPACE,  
 LIKE THIS COMMUNION, YOU KNOW,  OF PEOPLE OF THE SAME SEX,  
 AND, LIKE, QUITE OFTEN,  VERY HEDONISTIC,  
 BUT ALSO, THERE WAS A LOT  OF POLITICS HAPPENING  
 AT THATIN THAT ENVIRONMENT.
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME  
 WE ACTUALLY WORKED  WITH THIS TRANNY SYMBOL.
WE WANT TO TURN EVERYBODY  INTO TRANNIES,  
 SO WE GAVE OUT THE TRANNY MASKS  
 WITH THESE PICTURES  THAT ANOTHER FRIEND OF OURS TOOK  
 OF THESE TRANNIES FROM PARIS.
THESE MASKSTHEY HAVE  THIS SPECIAL LENSES  
 THAT MULTIPLY THE AMOUNT  OF LIGHT SPOTS.
AND PEOPLE WERE FASCINATED,  
 BECAUSE ONCE THEY PUT  THE MASK ON,  
 THEY WOULD SEE ALL THESE  DIFFERENT COLORS  
 AND DIFFERENT SHAPES.
[ indistinct conversations ]  
 REMEMBER I WAS DOING,  LIKE, THE  
 THE THING WITH  PUMPING THE INK FROM THE THING?
- YEAH, YEAH.
- THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS.
- OH.
- THAT'S WHERE THAT CAME.
CAN YOU TELL WHICH ONES  ARE MINE  
 AND WHICH ONES  ARE CHRISTOPHE'S?
- UM...  - I THINK IT'S A BIT OBVIOUS.
BUT I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE  
 - THIS IS CHRISTOPHE.
- YEAH.
- THIS IS YOU.
- YEAH.
- CHRISTOPHE, CHRISTOPHE...  - YEAH.
- CHRISTOPHE.
YOU?
- YEAH.
THE THING IS, I  - YOU'RE MORE...  
 - YEAH, I'M MORE...  
 - INTRICATE.
- INTRICATE.
THIS ONE IS IN THE CATALOG.
ACTUALLY, THIS WAS  THE VERY FIRST ONE I MADE.
- OH, YEAH?
- NOW I REMEMBER.
THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST ONE,  THE ONE I MADE HERE.
AND THEN...
WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD,  
 I WAS FASCINATED  BY THIS MAGAZINE  
 WHICH WAS CALLED DISNEYLANDIA,  
 WHICH IS "DISNEYLAND"  IN PORTUGUESE.
MY MOTHER WOULD READ IT FOR ME,  
 IT WOULD BE GONE  IN FIVE MINUTES,  
 AND I WOULD GET  REALLY FRUSTRATED.
AND THEN MY FATHER TAUGHT ME  
 TO CUT THE CHARACTERS  OUT OF THE MAGAZINE,  
 PUT THEM ON CARDBOARD,  AND I COULD MAKE MY OWN STORIES.
AND THAT EVOLVED ALONG THE YEARS  
 TO MARVEL SUPERHEROES,  ESPECIALLY THE X-MEN.
SO I WOULD CUT THE LITTLE  CHARACTERS OUT OF THE MAGAZINE  
 AND THE POWER RAYS  OR THE ARCHITECTURE.
AND I HAD A BOARD,  AND I WOULD LAY ON MY BED  
 AND START PLAYING WITH THEM  AND CREATE MY OWN STORIES.
[ indistinct dialogue ]  
 I THINK IT'S A LOT  RELATED TO THE WALLPAPER.
IT'S THE SAME SORT  OF FLAT-SURFACE APPROACH  
 TO THE IMAGERY.
MY FATHER WAS REALLY  MY CREATIVE CONNECTION.
WHEN I WAS BORN,  HE WAS ALREADY 60 YEARS OLD.
HE WAS VERY SOCIAL,  
 BUT MY MEMORY OF HIM IS THIS GUY  WHO'S ALWAYS AT HOME.
MY FATHER WAS A GENERAL  FROM THE ARMY.
HE WAS NOT IN FAVOR  OF THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP.
HE WAS FORCED TO RESIGN.
HE WAS ALSO A LITERATURE CRITIC  AND A POET  
 BESIDES BEING A DENTIST.
HE WOULD CONSTANTLY TELL ME,  
 "OH, MY GOD, YOU HAVE TO DO  SOMETHING WITH COLOR.
YOU'RE SUCH A COLORIST."
MY MOTHER WAS, LIKE,  QUITE THE OPPOSITE.
SUPER-CONSERVATIVE, BUT SHE  DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EDUCATION.
MY FATHER HAD BEEN REWRITING  HIS LAST BOOK FOREVER.
HE WOULD BE TYPING  LITTLE PCES, DIFFERENT WORDS,  
 AND PASTING THOSE WORDS  ON TOP OF THE OLD WORDS.
HIS LAST BOOK IS A WHOLE COLLAGE  
 OF DIFFERENT WORDS  THAT HE'D KEEP REPLACING.
[ indistinct conversation ]  
 HE SPENT A WHOLE YEAR IN '68  
 THE YEAR I WAS BORN,  WHICH WAS THE YEAR  
 THAT THE DICTATORSHIP  GOT MORE OPPRESSIVEAT HOME.
A LOT OF WHAT I DO NOWADAYS  IS DUE TO HIM.
AND TO MY MOTHER TOO,  BOTH OF THEM.
IT WAS A VERY GOOD COMBINATION,  IN FACT.
[ alarm beeping ]  
 [ motor whirring ]  
 THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST DRAWING  I MADE FOR THE SHOW AT DEITCH.
THE CORE CONCEPT OF THAT SHOW WAS DEMOLITION.
WE WERE LOOKING AT A FEW  DIFFERENT DEMOLITION SOURCES  
 RELATED TO DEMOLISHING THE CITY,  BECAUSE AT THAT POINT,  
 A LOT OF THE LONG ISLAND CITY  AND THE BROOKLYN NEIGHBORHOODS  
 WERE BEING DEMOLISHED  
 TO GIVE BIRTH  TO THESE BIG HIGH-RISES.
ME AND CHRISTOPHE,  
 WE WERE INTERESTED  IN THE DEMOLITION SITES,  
 AND WE WERE ACTUALLY MAKING  A LOT OF INSTALLATIONS  
 WHICH REPLICATED THAT IMAGERY.
THESE ARE SKETCHES  FROM THAT SHOW,  
 AND A LOT OF THESE THINGS  
 ARE ACTUALLY THINGS THAT  WE'D NEVER END UP PRODUCING,  
 LIKE THIS.
THIS WAS THE DJ BOOTH  
 MADE OF ALL THE TRASHED WOOD  WITH PLASTIC RIBBONS.
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SPACE  THAT YOU GO IN.
THERE'S, LIKE, A STAIRCASE HERE,  AND IT HAD A LITTLE DOOR.
AND IT HADTHIS IS A SAUSAGE,  
 AND THESE ARE FRENCH FRIES  OVER HERE.
I DON'T REMEMBER, LIKE,  
 WHY WE CAME UP WITH THIS  FRENCH FRIES AND SAUSAGE THING.
IT WASI WAS SORT OF OBSESSED  ABOUT THAT AT ONE POINT.
EVERYTHING HAD A LOOK  OF CONSTRUCTION,  
 SO THERE'S, LIKE, A TARP  LIKE, A BLUE TARP  
 ON TOP OF THE TRASH WOOD  STRUCTURE HERE.
SO WE CREATE SORT OF, LIKE,  A SHANTY HOUSE STRUCTURE.
WE CREATED THIS NEON BOX.
IT WAS LIKE A HOLE,  
 AND YOU WOULD PUT  YOUR HEAD THROUGH  
 AND THEN YOU WOULD SEE  YOUR FACE REFLECTED.
YOU HAD ALL THESE NEONS AROUND YOUR FACE.
IT WAS LIKE A ONE-WAY MIRROR.
FROM OUTSIDE, IT WAS ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT,  
 SO YOU WOULD SEE THIS PERSON'S FACE  
 WITH ALL THESE NEONS AROUND, FLICKERING AND STUFF.
THIS IS A ZINE THAT WE MADE  FOR THAT SHOW.
AND THIS WAS, LIKE  
 WE HAD, LIKE, 16 DIFFERENT  PEOPLE WORKING WITH US.
A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS FROM BRAZIL  WERE WORKING IN THE SHOW,  
 AND WE WERE  GIVING OUT THIS ZINE,  
 SO EVERYBODY HAD ONE OR TWO  PAGES FOR THIS COLLABORATION.
THERE WAS ONE FACADE  
 THAT STRUCK  BOTH ME AND CHRISTOPHE:  
 THESE PINK STONES AND, LIKE,  GRAY PLASTIC SHINGLES.
WE SPENT TWO MONTHS COLLECTING  ALL THE TRASH WOOD  
 FROM ALL THESE HOUSES THAT WERE  BEING DEMOLISHED IN THAT AREA  
 TO USE IN THAT INSTALLATION.
AT THE SAME TIME,  WE CONNECTED WITH KENNY SCHARF.
AND THEN WE REMEMBERED  NUKE BOMBS  
 PAINTINGS HE USED TO MAKE  IN THE '80s  
 AND THEN I SAID,  
 "WHAT IF WE TURN ONE  OF HIS NUKE BOMBS INTO A NEON?"
THIS PLACE WAS  RIGHT ON THE WATER,  
 AND IT HAD THIS MOST  IDYLLIC VIEW OF MANHATTAN  
 RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.
I SAID,  "LET'S NUKE MANHATTAN.
"LET'S PUT THE BOMB  RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SKYLINE.
"THE HISTORY OF THE CITY  IS BEING DEMOLISHED.
"LET'S POINT THAT OUT,  AND THEN LET'S POINT OUT  
 THAT PEOPLE SHOULD ALSO MAKE  THEIR OWN HISTORY IN THE CITY."
RELATED TO THAT,  WE BROUGHT ANOTHER SUBJECT  
 WHICH WE WERE WORKING ON  FOR A WHILE,  
 WHICH IS THE TRANNY,  THE TRANSGENDER IMAGE,  
 AND WE USED THAT AS ANOTHER  SYMBOL OF DEMOLITION:  
 DEMOLITION OF IDENTITY,  A DEMOLITION OF YOUR OWN BODY.
WE HAD THIS GIANT DOLL  WITH A WOMAN BODY,  
 BUT ONE SIDE WAS A MAN FACE;  OTHER SIDE WAS A WOMAN FACE.
WE WANTED TO REUSE THAT DOLL  
 AND TO SOMEHOW  DEMOLISH HER AS WELL,  
 BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING  FROM THE PAST  
 THAT WE WANTED TO CONNECT  THIS DEMOLITION IDEA  
 WE WANTED TO DEMOLISH  OUR OWN WORK.
SO WE BROKE HER APART,  
 AS IF THE BROOKLYN FACADE  HAD JUST POPPED RIGHT ONTO HER.
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER  WHICH WITCH IS THE ONE  
 THAT IS DEAD IN THE BEGINNING  OF WIZARD OF OZ,  
 WHICH YOU JUST SEE THE SHOES.
THE WEST, THE EAST  I DON'T KNOW.
A LOT OF WHAT WE MAKE  STARTS BY WRITING  
 OR IDEAS OR WORDS OR LISTS  OF THINGS I NEED TO DO,  
 AND IT'S LIKE CREATING  A UNIVERSE, SOMEHOW.
WORKING TOGETHER, IT'S VERY  
 IT'S LONELY, BECAUSE I'M  WHAT HAPPENS THAT, YOU KNOW,  
 I'M AT MY STUDIO IN NEW YORK,  
 AND CHRISTOPHE IS IN HIS STUDIO  IN PARIS.
AND THEN WE EXCHANGE EMAILS.
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR A SHOW,  AND I WRITE  
 I DESCRIBE THIS IDEA  IN THE EMAIL.
AND THEN HE WRITES BACK TO ME,  
 AND THEN HE GIVES ME  HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT IT  
 AND I GIVE MY THOUGHTS  ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS.
SO WE'RE ALWAYS, LIKE,  KIND OF EXCHANGING EMAILS  
 ABOUT EACH OTHER'S VISION  OR IDEAS FOR A CERTAIN SHOW.
[ percussive rhythm ]  
 - WE WERE, IN SOME WAYS,  MEANT TO WORK TOGETHER.
I THINK WE HAVE, LIKE, THE SAME  SORT OF VIEW ON LIFE, ON ART.
ELI IS ONE PERSON;  I'M SOMEBODY ELSE.
[ laughs ]  
 AND WE HAVE OUR OWN DIFFERENCES,  
 AND I GUESS THAT'S THE GREAT  THING ABOUT COLLABORATION, ALSO,  
 IS TO HAVE THOSE  TWO DIFFERENCES CONNECT.
[ indistinct conversations ]  
 - I THINK THERE'S A STRATEGY  IN WHAT WE MAKE,  
 WHICH IS FOR EVERYTHING  TO BECOME ONE.
THE VIEWER BECOME ONE  WITH THE INSTALLATION.
THE CORE OF WHAT WE MAKE,  
 IT'S NOT OBJECT;  IT'S ENERGY.
YOU KNOW, WE CREATE THIS ENERGY,  
 AND THEN THIS ENERGY,  IT'S THERE.
IT HAPPENS IN ONE MOMENT,  AND THEN IT'S GONE.
YOU CAN'T SAVE THAT ENERGY.
YOU CAN'T SELL THAT ENERGY.
YOU CAN SHARE THAT ENERGY  IN THAT MOMENT.
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE IT  SOMEWHERE ELSE.

 TO DO INSTALLATIONS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
AND FOR THE PRICE OF THE MATERIALS AND MY TICKET,  
 I WENT TO THESE DIFFERENT PLACES  AND DID AN ART WORK.
[ rapid jazz music ]  
 â™ª  â™ª   
 THEY WERE LIKE STATEMENTS  OF THE REALITY THAT YOU FEEL  
 IN THE CONVERSATIONS  THAT ARTISTS HAVE  
 WITH EACH OTHER  AND WITH THE WORLD  
 AND WITH THEIR TIMES.
ONE THING THAT THESE WORKS  CLEARLY DO IS STATE  
 THAT THE PROCESS,  THE DRAWING TEXTURE EQUAL FORM.
AND IT'S ABOUT DRAWING.
AND THESE IDEAS HAVE COME  FROM, REALLY, PAINTING IDEAS,  
 YET THEY'RE DIMENSIONAL.
THIS IS ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS  BEEN INTERESTED IN EXPLORING.
EAT MEATIS A SAND-CAST BRONZE.
IT HAS A LOVELY PATINA  
 FROM BEING OUT IN THE ELEMENTS  OVER 30, 40 YEARS.
[ indistinct conversations ]  
 I THINK OF MYSELF AS A PAINTER  
 PROBABLY BECAUSE I DON'T  USE GLUE.
I FOUND MY SPACE, SO TO SPEAK,  
 BECAUSE I WAS PARTICULARLY  INTERESTED  
 IN PAINTERLY MATERIALS  AND ALSO FORM AND SPACE  
 AND WHERE THE GESTURE  COULD TAKE THE MATERIAL.
ALL OF THEM ARE DRAWN  WITH EITHER A BUCKET OR A CAN.
THE USE OF THE BODY,  THE USE OF THE HAND,  
 THE USE OF THE MOVEMENT  OF THE BODY,  
 DANCING AND RHYTHM  
 I WAS JUST VERY INTERESTED  IN THAT KIND OF BODILY GESTURE.
TAKE IT DOWN, BILL.
QUICK!
THEY'RE ALL POLYURETHANE,  
 THE SAME POLYURETHANE  USED IN INSULATION.
I MADE A COUPLE OF PCES  OF PHOSPHORESCENCE.
I HAD TO LIGHT THEM,  AND THEY ABSORBED THE LIGHT.
AND THEN THE LIGHTS WERE  TURNED OFF ON A TIMER.
AND WHAT HAPPENED,  
 BECAUSE OF THE FLOWS  AND THE POURS AND THE GRAVITY,  
 WHAT YOU WOULD SEE  IS THEM COMING DOWN  
 AND RISING AGAIN  AT THE SAME TIME.
I'M VERY INTERESTED  IN HOW THINGS CHANGE  
 THROUGH OUR READING  OF THE GRAVITY IN THE FORM.
IF A WATERFALL FREEZES,  HOW DO YOU REALLY READ IT?
YOU CAN READ IT  GOING UP OR DOWN,  
 AND HOW DO YOU READ IT?
[ static buzzing ]  
 THIS IS MY SISTER JANE.
SHE'S GETTING ON THE MOTORBIKED  
 STILL MOTORBIKE  WEIGHT-REDUCING BIKE.
THE CAMERA HAD TO BE  TURNED SIDEWAYS  
 SO I COULD GET JANE IN.
SHE WAS RIDING THE BIKE.
SHE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  HOW TO TURN IT ON.
MY FATHER'S WARNING HER  TO HOLD ONTO THE HANDLEBARS.
AND IT STARTED UP.
NOW SHE WANTS TO TURN IT OFF,  
 AND SHE'S WONDERING  HOW TO TURN IT OFF.
IT'S BEING UNPLUGGED.
THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.
WE'RE ROUNDING THE CORNER.
SHE LIVES ABOUT TEN-MINUTE RIDE  IN SMALL TOWN  
 CALLED SULPHUR, LOUISIANA.
HERE SHE IS.
SHE LOOKS QUITE PALE TO ME,  
 AND I WAS VERY SURPRISED  THAT SHE WAS SO PALE.
SHE'S ASKING ME,  WHAT AM I DOING?
[ creaking ]  
 I REALLY HAD A VERY RICH  CHILDHOOD, I THINK,  
 AND ALSO TRAVELED TO GREECE  
 VERY EARLY ON WITH MY GRANDMOTHER.
TRAVELED THE ISLANDS AND INTO THE MOUNTAINS.
- AHH!
- WELL, MY BROS LIVE OUT THERE, MAN.
- IT'S PRE-CLASSIC GREECE.
THEY SAY, EVEN, ON THIS ISLAND  
 THAT THERE WERE THE BEGINNINGS OF MAN, OF WOMAN,  
 JUST REALLY EARLY, EARLY  CIVILIZATION.
- OH, WELL WHAT DO YOU DO  ON A WEEKEND?
- NAH, MAN, WE GO LOOKING  FOR A FEW FIGHTS, YOU KNOW.
- I WAS BORN IN LAKE CHARLES, LOUISIANA.
I REALLY LIKE THE CARNIVAL  
 ON LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN AND THE FUN HOUSE.
- THAT GIRL IS SO BIG  AND SO FAT,  
 IT TAKES FOUR MEN TO HUG HER  AND A BOXCAR TO LUG HER.
- IMAGES JUMPING OUT,  
 THE PHOSPHORESCENT QUALITY OF THE IMAGES.
THEY SEEMED VERY REAL TO ME  AT THE TIME.
- THIS IMAGE HERE.
- THIS IMAGE HERE.
- GOOD.
- WHICH IMAGE?
- OKAY, LET'S START  RECORDING NOW.
- THIS IMAGE HERE.
- START RECORDING NOW.
- WE ARE RECORDING.
- WE ARE RECORDING.
- START RECORDING, I SAID.
- NO, I SAID  START RECORDING NOW.
- THIS IS A TAPE I MADE.
- THIS IS A TAPE HE MADE OF A TAPE SHE MADE  
 OF A TAPE HE MADE... - OF MORRIS...  
 - IN HER STUDIO.
- IN MY STUDIO.
- THIS IS A TAPE HE MADE...  - SOMETIMES...  
 - LOUISIANA HAD A WHOLE AREA  OF WATERWAYS  
 THAT LED TO A BIG LAKE  THAT THEN LED TO THE GULF,  
 SO THERE WERE ALL KINDS  OF CHANNELS,  
 AND I KNEW THEM, RIDING AROUND  IN A LITTLE MOTORCAR.
BEING RIGHT THERE  ON THE WATER...
I HAD HORSES...  
 - THIS TAPE ONSCREEN  IS RAW MATERIAL.
REPHOTOGRAPHING HIS TAPE  MADE IT HER WORK.
OR COMMENTING ON IT  MADE IT HER WORK.
OR BOTH.
SHE IS HEARD BUT NEVER SEEN.
- [ indistinct female voice ]  
 - NOTHING HERE HAS BEEN  REPHOTOGRAPHED.
[ horn honks ]  
 - IT STARTED BY AN INVITATION  FROM ANAND:  
 "ANAND SARABHAI WOULD LIKE  FOR YOU TO COME TO INDIA,  
 "AND RAUSCHENBERG  AND ROBERT MORRIS  
 ARE INTRODUCING ME TO YOU."
I VISITED INDIA  THE LAST 35 YEARS.
AFTER ABOUT TEN YEARS,  ANAND SAID TO ME,  
 "LYNDA, I HAVE A WELL HERE,  AND I WANT TO COVER IT."
I SAID, "WELL, I'D LIKE  TO MAKE A FOUNTAIN."
HE SAID,  "NO, I DON'T WANT A FOUNTAIN."
HE SAID,  
 "I WANT A SCULPTURE  TO COVER THE WELL."
I MADE A 15-FOOT TRAPEZOID WALL.
I BEGAN DRAWING ON THIS WALL.
I THOUGHT I COULD DRAW  AN ELEPHANT  
 WHEN I WAS TWO OR THREE  YEARS OLD.
SO I BEGAN DRAWING AN ELEPHANT,  
 NEVER HAVING CARVED  A PCE OF THIS SCALE.
I GREW UP IN A BRICK HOME,  RECYCLED BRICK,  
 SO WHEN I VISITED HERE,  
 THIS KIND OF REMINDED ME  OF LOUISIANA.
WE HAVE A SEMITROPICAL  PLACE THERE.
SO BRICK IS VERY FAMILIAR TO ME.
THIS PARTICULAR BRICK IS SOFT,  SO IT WAS EASILY CARVABLE.
IT ENDED UP, AT ONE END,  BEING VERY VASE-LIKE.
AND AT THE OTHER END,  BEING KIND OF ELEPHANTINE.
WHEN I FINISHED,  
 RATHER THAN A FOUNTAIN,  I HAD A PLANTER FOR A PALM TREE,  
 SO I PLANTED A PALM TREE.
THERE WAS ANOTHER IMAGE  THAT I ALSO CREATED AFTER THAT:  
 A TWO-HEADED SNAKE.
I THOUGHT OF IT AS  KIND OF INSIDE OUT.
PEOPLE BEGAN TO COME THERE  AND WORSHIP.
SNAKES CAN TAKE ON OTHER FORMS.
A SNAKE COULD BE A KNOT,  
 AND THE KNOT COULD BE  THE BEGINNING OF A LIFE.
IT WAS A WAY OF ARRIVING  AT SOMETHING ELSE  
 OTHER THAN A WALL AROUND A TREE  OR OUT INTO SPACE.
A KNOT IS SOMETIME AN IMPLOSION,  
 BUT A KNOT COULD ALSO BE  AN EXPLOSION OF ENERGY.
I'VE DONE BOTH WITH THE IDEA  OF THAT FORM.
IT'S EMBRYONIC.
IT GROWS.
IT COMES ABOUT.
IT EXTENDS ITS ARMS, LEGS.
THE FLORAL ASPECT HAS OCCURRED.
I WAS SHOWING  THESE WRAPPED PCES OF GAUZE  
 I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK  OF THE GAUZE AS BEING THE SKIN  
 AND THE CANVAS WRAPPED  IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE WIRE.
AND SOMEONE SAID  THEY WERE LIKE KOTEXES,  
 AND I WAS INSULTED,  BUT I REALIZED THEY WERE RIGHT.
THEY WERE LONG AND TALL,  
 AND FOR ME, THEY WERE  KIND OF GHOST IMAGES  
 AND TOOK THE PLACE OF THE CANVAS  AND THE PAINT.
AND THEN I STARTED TYING THEM  IN SIMPLE KNOTS.
I WAS THINKING  OF AN ORGANIC CUBISM,  
 AND I WANTED TO CREATE A SPACE.
AND THEN STELLA SAW  THE SPARKLED KNOTS  
 HE WAS ON THE PANEL  
 AND I GOT A GUGGENHEIM  FOR THESE.
WHEN I WAS AT THE ACROPOLIS  AS A VERY LITTLE GIRL,  
 I REMEMBER BEING TOTALLY  CAUGHT UP WITH THE CARYATIDS  
 BECAUSE THEY WERE FEMALE.
THEY HAD A ICE-LIKE QUALITY.
WHEN I DISCOVERED  THE POLYURETHANE PLASTIC  
 THAT LOOKED AS GLASS,  
 I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT PEOPLE  THOUGHT IT WAS GLASS.
AND IT HAD AN ILLUSION OF ICE,  OF FROZEN WATER,  
 AND I WANTED THESE GRACES  TO BE A FOUNTAIN.
- WE ARE HERE TO TAKE  THIS LOVELY LITTLE GIRL.
WATCH WHAT SHE DOES.
INTO THE BOX, SWEETHEART.
YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR HEAD BELONGS?
THIS WAY.
LOOK AT THAT.
HER HEAD IS HERE, HER FEET ARE HERE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  
 NOTICING THAT THERE IS  NOT VERY MUCH ROOM  
 FOR THE LITTLE GIRL  TO BE IN THERE,  
 WATCH WHAT WE'RE DOING.
CLOSE THE LITTLE BOX LIKE SO.
WE TAKE A SOLID BLADE.
WE CUT RIGHT DOWN  
 BETWEEN THE GAZIPPY  AND THE GAZOP  
 OR WE COULD DO THE OTHER END.
DOESN'T MATTER.
AND NOW THE OTHER END,  THE GAZIPPY AND THE GAZOPPY.
THEN WE TAKE ANOTHER BLADE,  
 AND WE GO BETWEEN THE FLIPPY  AND THE FLOPPY.
[ chuckles ] YOU GOT TO KNOW WHERE  THE FLIPPY IS AND THE FLOPPY.
RIGHT DOWN THERE,  WE CUT OFF HER GAZOOPAKYPER.
