 - I UNDERSTOOD  FROM A REALLY YOUNG AGE  
 THAT WORK HAD THIS POTENTIAL  TO CONVEY TIME.
- I THINK MY WORK HAS  PRINCIPALLY BEEN ABOUT CHANGE,  
 NONFIXITY OF THINGS.
- I THINK  I'M INTERESTED IN ART  
 BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS DEALING  WITH NEW POSSIBILITIES.
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY, HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY  TO THE CAMERA?
YOU GOT TO LOOK AT THE CAMERA.
THE CAMERA'S OVER THERE.
NO, NOT THERE.
IT'S OVER THERE.
LOOK, SUNNY.
CAMERA'S THERE.
I UNDERSTOOD  FROM A REALLY YOUNG AGE  
 THAT WORK HAD THIS POTENTIAL  TO CONVEY TIME.
IT WAS LITERALLY GOING  TO THE TOLEDO ART MUSEUM  
 OR CLEVELAND  
 AND STANDING BEFORE  A LOT OF THE MASTERS,  
 REALIZING WHAT THAT DEPICTED  
 IN RELATIONSHIP  TO A NARRATIVE OF THE TIME.
THE EARLY PORTRAITS  OF MY FRIENDS  
 IS BECAUSE OF HANS HOLBEIN.
I WAS LOOKING AT HOLBEIN  
 IN RELATIONSHIP  TO MAKING THAT WORK,  
 ESPECIALLY THE IMPORTANCE  OF A HISTORY OF AESTHETICS  
 WHEN YOU MIGHT BE PHOTOGRAPHING  SUBJECTS THAT PEOPLE  
 DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT  OR LOOK AT.
IT COULDN'T BE  LIKE A DIANE ARBUS PHOTOGRAPH.
IT HAD TO COMPLETELY FOCUS  ON THE BODY AND ALSO COLOR.
I HAD TO SEDUCE THE VIEWER  IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
GIRLFRIENDS,I THINK,  WILL ALWAYS BE ONGOING.
I THINK THAT IT'S GONNA BE  JUST A COLLECTION OF IMAGES  
 THAT I CONTINUE  THROUGHOUT MY LIFE HOPEFULLY.
DIANA NYAD IS DEFINITELY  GOING TO BE  
 INCLUDED IN THE BODY OF WORK  WHEN I EXHIBIT IT NEXT.
I LIKE THIS BLUE.
I THINK IT'S GOOD TO PHOTOGRAPH  IT ON A DIFFERENT COLOR  
 THAN LAST YEAR.
THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HER BACK IS,  TO ME,  
 JUST, LIKE, ONE OF THESE  
 PERFECT, AMAZING  BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHS  
 OF THIS 61-YEAR-OLD,  POWERFUL WOMAN.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO, BUDDY.
ALL RIGHT.
I WANT YOU TO TRY TO GO  IN YOUR HEAD  
 WHERE YOU'RE GOING  WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING, OKAY?
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE  IN THAT PLACE A BIT.
OKAY, BLINK,  AND THEN OPEN YOUR EYES.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 AND LOOK RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA,  DI.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 - [ indistinct speech ]  
 - YEAH.
HOW'S THE LIGHT LOOK, NICOLE?
- IT'S GOOD.
HERTHE SHADOW'S A LITTLE DARK.
- CAN I SEE?
I LIKE THAT, WITH THE CAP ON  AND THE GOGGLES TOO.
- I LIKE IT TOO.
- I THINK IT'S GOOD.
- YEAH.
- I LOVE THAT.
- THAT'S COOL.
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
WELL, I THINK MAYBE I NEED  THE 80 LENS.
YEAH.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 [ shutter clicks ]  
 I DON'T THINK  THAT SURFERSWOULD HAVE EXISTED,  
 IN TERMS OF ME MAKING THEM,  
 IF I HADN'T MADE THE ICEHOUSES.
THE CORRELATION  BETWEEN SURFERSAND ICEHOUSES  
 IS THIS NOTION  OF A TEMPORARY COMMUNITY  
 THAT EXISTS ON THE WATER.
ONE IS A FROZEN  TEMPORARY COMMUNITY.
THE OTHER IS A COMMUNITY THAT  IS OUT IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.
BOTH OF THEM CONTAIN THAT KIND  OF METAPHOR OF WAITING.
YOU CAN SLOW DOWN.
YOU CAN STOP.
AND YOU CAN MAYBE EVEN HAVE  AN ETHEREAL MOMENT.
[ birds squawking ]  
 THE TRICK IS  TO NOT SPILL THE COFFEE.
IT'S OKAY IF THE CAMERA DROPS,  BUT THE COFFEE.
I GREW UP IN SANDUSKY, OHIO,  
 AND WE LEFT WHEN I WAS 13  TO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA.
SANDUSKY, OHIO  IS THE SOMEWHAT SMALL TOWN  
 THAT'S LOCATED RIGHT  ON LAKE ERIE.
IT'S MOST KNOWN  FOR CEDAR POINT AMUSEMENT PARK,  
 WHERE EVERYBODY  FROM THE MIDWEST COMES.
CLEVELAND IS ABOUT 45 MINUTES  NORTH OF SANDUSKY.
WHEN THE CLEVELAND CLINIC  APPROACHED ME  
 TO DO A BODY OF WORK,  
 I IMMEDIATELY PROPOSED  THAT I WOULD  
 GO AND PHOTOGRAPH LAKE ERIE,  
 AND SPECIFICALLY  BECAUSE I WANTED  
 TO GO BACK TO SANDUSKY.
ONE THING I DON'T LIKE IS  
 HOW THE BIRDS GO IN MY HORIZON.
I WOULD PREFER  THAT THEY WOULD GO AWAY.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER  THAT I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE  
 TO DO A PCE  THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO  
 STAY THERE  FOR THE LIFE OF THE BUILDING.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 THE FACT  THAT I WAS COMMISSIONED  
 ALLOWED ME TO SPEND A YEAR  
 GOING IN AND OUT  ON SIX DIFFERENT TRIPS  
 TO MY HOMETOWN  
 AND LOOK AT IT AGAIN  
 THROUGH A 50-YEAR-OLD  PHOTOGRAPHER'S EYES.
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE WAVES  BREAKING THAT MUCH IN IT.
AW, IT GOT ME WET.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 [ shutter clicks ]  
 EVERY SEASON THAT'S REPRESENTED  IN THE PCE  
 IS FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS  OF THAT SEASON.
EXCEPT FOR WINTER HAS FIVE.
AND WINTER HAS FIVE,  SPECIFICALLY,  
 BECAUSE WE ALWAYS THINK  THAT THE FROZEN LANDSCAPE  
 WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR.
THIS IS SUNRISE.
THIS IS SUNSET.
THIS IS SUNRISE  IN THE SAME LOCATION.
YOU'LL SEE THE FOOT TRACKS HERE.
I LOVE THAT A CAREFUL VIEWER  WILL PICK UP THAT LITTLE MOMENT  
 THAT THAT IS THE SAME PLACE  AT DIFFERENT TIMES,  
 DIFFERENT DAYS.
BUT I LOVE THAT THE LITTLE  ANIMAL FOOTPRINTS ARE HERE.
AND THEN THERE'S JUST A SLIGHT  BAND OF PINK IN THE SKY.
JUST DOESUGH  ALL THESE CRAZY THINGS.
SITTING WITH IT ISN'T  SITTING WITH IT FOR A LONG TIME.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE HOW  I PHOTOGRAPH PORTRAITS AS WELL.
I MAKE DECISIONS FAIRLY QUICKLY.
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE  THAT I CAN WALK INTO THE STUDIO  
 THREE DAYS IN A ROW  AND HAVE IT HOLD ME.
AND NOW THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS:  "AMUSEMENT PARK OR SAILBOAT?"
NOW, I COULD DO AWAY  
 WITH THE CEDAR POINT ONE  ALTOGETHER  
 AND GO TO  THAT REALLY ETHEREAL FOG ONE.
SEE HOW ATTACHED I AM  TO CEDAR POINT AS A PLACE.
IT'S PRETTY NICE.
[ laughing ]  
 IT'S A LITTLE SAD.
SO THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO LET  YOUR NOSTALGIA GO AWAY,  
 IF YOU CAN.
I DON'T KNOW.
[ laughs ]  
 I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN LET  
 I THINK SO, ULTIMATELY,  TO MAKE A BETTER PCE, YEAH.
SO...
THE FACT THAT THIS IS GOING  TO BE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING  
 THAT CAN BE LIFE-CHANGING  FOR PEOPLE  
 FOR EITHER GOOD NEWS,  BAD NEWS.
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PLACE  THAT'S ETHEREAL  
 TO ALMOST ESCAPE TO.
AND I THINK OF CHANGE  IN A CERTAIN WAY  
 AS ESCAPE IN MY MIND.
LIKE, THEY WEIGH OUT TO BE  A LITTLE BIT OF THE SAME.
AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S, UM  THAT MIGHT BE MORE PERSONAL.
YOU KNOW?
IT MIGHT HAVE  
 IT MIGHT HAVE MORE  OF A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP  
 TO ACTUALLY WHAT THIS PLACE  DID TO ME WHEN I WAS A KID  
 WAS THAT I WAS ALLOWED  TO ESCAPE, SOMETIMES,  
 SITUATIONS THAT WERE  REALLY HARD ON ME  
 ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL  WITHIN OUR FAMILY.
AND LITERALLY,  I USED THE LANDSCAPE  
 TO CHANGE MY EMOTIONAL STATE.
AND I THINK THAT  THAT KIND OF COMES UP FOR ME  
 IN RELATIONSHIP TO, OFTEN,  HOW I PHOTOGRAPH A PLACE.
AS I FIND THIS,  WHAT I DEEM AS A  
 AS A SAFE PLACE TO GO.
[ indistinct announcements  over P.A. ]
THERE WERE YEARS THAT I  EMPTIED OUT AMERICAN CITIES.
AND WHAT I MEAN BY EMPTYING OUT,  
 THAT I JUST WANTED TO LOOK  
 AT THE SPECIFICITY OF IDENTITY  THROUGH THE ARCHITECTURE.
AND SO THERE WEREN'T PEOPLE  IN THOSE BIG PANORAMAS.
I THINK IT STARTED  WITH THE BODY OF WORK  
 IN AND AROUND HOME.
I WAS BACK ON THE STREET  WITH A CAMERA IN MY HAND  
 LIKE I WAS IN THE EARLY '80s  IN SAN FRANCISCO.
AND I WAS LOOKING  AT THESE GROUPS OF PEOPLE  
 THAT HAD COME TOGETHER,  
 EITHER TO CELEBRATE  U.S.C.
FOOTBALL  
 OR MARTIN LUTHER KING  
 OR A RALLY AGAINST  31 REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS.
I REALIZED THAT IT WAS  REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME  
 TO NO LONGER  EMPTY OUT THE LANDSCAPE.
BUT TO FULFILL  THIS OTHER KIND OF NOTION  
 OF CREATING DOCUMENTS  OF OUR TIME.
I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE  AMERICAN LANDSCAPES,  
 THE NOTION  OF AMERICAN LANDSCAPE  
 IN TERMS OF AN IDENTITY.
[ birds chirping ]  
 OH, MY GOSH.
THE TREES ARE AMAZING.
- OH, YEAH.
WISTERIA?
- NO.
- NO?
- JACARANDAS.
- OH, RIGHT.
- YEAH, WISTERIA'S KIND OF  A VINE THAT GROWS OVER THINGS.
- OH, YEAH.
WHAT  
 - BUT PEOPLE FROM THE MIDWEST  SAY, "JACK-UH-RAN-DUH."
[ sniffs ]  
 OKAY, LET'S GO SEE  OUR GARAGE FRIENDS  
 AND SEE IF THEY'RE NICE  
 AND LET ME TAKE A PICTURE  OF THEM.
IT'S KIND OF A PERFECT  PORTRAIT DAY.
- MM-HMM.
- HEY, GUYS.
HOW'S IT GOING?
HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?
YOU KNOW, I LIVE UP THE STREET,  
 AND I ALWAYS COME HERE  AND GET MY TIRES FIXED.
I'M DOING A PHOTO SERIES  
 OF SHOPKEEPERS  IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD  DO A PORTRAIT OF YOU.
OKAY.
OKAY, READY?
RIGHT HERE WITH ME.
JUST RELAX.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 GOOD.
LET ME LOOK AT THAT.
AH...VERY GOOD.
NOW, RIGHT HERE.
OKAY, MUY BIEN.
THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
- HAVE A GOOD TIME.
THANK YOU.
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
I REALLY SHOULD LEARN  HOW TO SPEAK SPANISH.
- I KNOW.
- IT'S REALLY RIDICULOUS.
I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES,  AND I CAN'T SPEAK SPANISH.
YOU STUDIED FRENCH.
- I KNOW.
- WHAT GOOD  IS THAT FOR YOU HERE, HUH?
I STUDIED GERMAN.
IT'S NOT REALLY WORKING FOR US,  OUR LANGUAGES.
- I KNOW.
- SEE WHY THAT  WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?
[ shutter clicks ]  
 AND AGAIN.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 PERFECTO.
AND AGAIN.
[ shutter clicks ]  
 [ shutter clicks ]  
 LET ME LOOK AT MY FOCUS.
WELL, I LIKE  HOW THE WINDOW FRAMED HER.
- YEAH.
- THAT'S NICE.
- YEAH.
- THAT'S A REALLY KIND FACE.
- YEAH.
- SO...
THE CURATOR JENS HOFFMANN  
 APPROACHED  A GROUP OF PHOTOGRAPHERS.
AND HE WANTED TO EXTEND  THE BODY OF WORK  
 THAT THE FARM SECURITY  ADMINISTRATION,  
 THE F.S.A.
DID IN THE 1930s  UNDER ROOSEVELT  
 THAT WAS HEADED BY ROY STRYKER.
AND ROY STRYKER WAS THE ONE  WHO GOT DOROTHEA LANGE  
 AND WALKER EVANS TO MAKE  
 THESE GREAT DOCUMENTS  OF THE DEPRESSION.
THE CURATOR JENS HOFFMANN  
 ASKED A GROUP OF  CONTEMPORARY ART PHOTOGRAPHERS  
 TO BASICALLY BELIEVE  THAT HE IS ROY STRYKER.
AND HE'S REEXAMINING  AND INVOKING  
 THE F.S.A.
PERIOD OF PHOTOGRAPHY.
AND I CHOSE TO PHOTOGRAPH  
 THE SHOPKEEPERS  IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK  IS MORE THAN THE COLOR IN THESE  
 THAT WORK THE BEST FOR ME IS  
 THE QUALITY OF LIGHT,  THAT I HAVE THE DAYLIGHT IN IT.
AND I THINK THAT WHEN  YOU'RE BALANCING STROBE  
 WITH DAYLIGHT  AND THAT'S WHY I TOOK DOWN  
 THE ONE OF HIM, LIKE, SMILING  IN THE GROCERY STORE,  
 IS BECAUSE IT WAS TOO STROBE-Y.
AND THE SAME WITH THE MANAGER,  
 IT READ TOO MUCH  AS PRESS PHOTOGRAPHY, ACTUALLY.
IT'S TRYING TO GET AWAY  FROM KIND OF A JOURNALIST READ.
AND FOR ME, PART OF THAT IS  
 WHAT HAPPENS WITH LIGHT  IN AN IMAGE,  
 THAT I NEED IT TO BE BALANCED  BETWEEN STROBE AND DAYLIGHT,  
 FOR IT TO BE EFFECTIVE  AND FOR IT TO WORK FOR ME.
MAYBE...
I THINK THIS IS  A LOVELY PORTRAIT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ONE  WILL MAKE IT.
I LIKE IT, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF  IT'S A GOOD ENOUGH PHOTOGRAPH.
BUT WHAT I KNOW RIGHT NOW  IN LOOKING AT THESE IS,  
 THESE FOUR DO SOMETHING  
 THAT I THINK THAT I CAN BE  HELD WITH,  
 UM, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT DAY  COMING INTO THE STUDIO  
 AND THE NEXT DAY.
BUT AS YOU MAKE MORE,  THAT'S THE THING WITH EDITING,  
 THEN YOU GO, LIKE, "OH, WELL,  THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK NOW."
YOU JUST MOVE IT AROUND  AND YOU MOVE IT AROUND  
 UNTIL IT FEELS  LIKE THIS RIGHT BALANCE TO YOU.
OH, MY GOSH.
HE'S GETTING SO CUTE.
- RANDY HEAVY.
- ARE YOU HEAVY?
LOOK AT IT.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE DOG?
OOH, I CAN'T BELIEVE  IT CLEARED UP THE WAY IT DID.
- I KNOW.
THE SUN STARTED COMING OUT.
I WAS LIKE, "WOW."
- I KNOW.
OKAY, YOU WANT TO  YOU WANT TO GO PICK STUFF, BUD?
LET'S GO TO THE GARDEN.
- WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE GARDEN.
- NO.
- UH-OH.
- YEAH, THEN YOU CAN COME BACK  AND PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
- CAN I GO TOO, DADDY?
- HUH?
- CAN I GO TOO?
- YEAH, YOU GUYS CAN GO.
YOU CAN GO.
- NO PRACTICE TODAY  
 - I KNOW.
- SO YOU'RE FREE.
- YEAH, YOU WANT TO COME DOWN  TO THE GARDEN?
YOU GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN  TO THE GARDEN IN AWHILE.
HEY, OLIVER, DO YOU WANT  TO GET YOUR SCOOTER?
- I'M FINE.
- NO?
OKAY.
AGH!
OH!
ASHLEY!
[ laughs ]  
 SEE, THIS IS WHY I NEED TO START  PLAYING CATCH WITH OLIVER.
HUH?
- LOOK.
- ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT DRIVES ME AS A PHOTOGRAPHER  
 IS JUST EXTREME CURIOSITY.
ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU TALLER THAN ME NOW?
- I THINK THAT'S IT.
ALMOST.
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE.
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
- EARLY ON, I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING  
 AT THE FORMATION  OF COMMUNITY  
 IN RELATIONSHIP TO FINDING  MYSELF WITHIN THE POPULACE.
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I HAVE  BEEN DRIVEN TO THE IDEA  
 OF CREATING MOMENTS  OF REPRESENTATION OF MY TIME IS,  
 NOT ONLY FINDING MYSELF  WITHIN THAT,  
 IT'S ALSO THIS UNBELIEVABLE  HUMAN NEED.
NO WORRIES.
THERE YOU GO.
YOU JUST PUT  THAT IN THE COMPOST.
SO IT SEEMS, IN A CERTAIN WAY,  
 I'M ALLOWING MYSELF TO GO BACK  
 TO THOSE  STREET PHOTOGRAPHY ROOTS.
IT'S, LIKE, WHERE I LAND  AND WHAT I OBSERVE  
 IS WHAT I'M MAKING IMAGES OF.
- LIMBO TIME!
- WHOA.
- RACE YOU!
- I REALLY WANTED TO PLAY.
- NO, YOU GET TO PLAY RIGHT  AFTER WE WALK IN THE HOUSE.
- WHY WALKING INTO THE HOUSE?
- IT'S HOW THEY FINISH  THE PCE.
THEY'RE FILMING US.
- WHAT?
- OH, LOOK.
I GOT A BOX.
- THIS IS A GROUP PHOTOGRAPH.
AND IN A GROUP PHOTOGRAPH,  
 YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT KINSHIP,  YOU KNOW.
KINSHIP,  IT'S A PARTICULAR GROUP.
AND THEN THEY HAPPEN TO BE  CLOSE TOGETHER.
ORIGINALLY,  THEY WERE SPREAD WIDE APART.
YOU KNOW,  SO WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS,  
 TO BRING THEM TOGETHER  SO THAT THEY ARE A GROUP.
I COME FROM A FAMILY  OF VERY MANY PEOPLE,  
 ABOUT 32 SIBLINGS,  
 ANDAND PROBABLY  THIS IS A REFLECTION OF THAT.
I WAS BORN IN GHANA.
MY MOM DIED  WHEN I WAS TODDLER,  
 PRETTY YOUNG,  ABOUT TWO OR THREE.
AND SO I HAD TO LIVE  WITH MY MATERNAL UNCLE,  
 YOU KNOW, A REVEREND.
AND WE LIVED IN A MISSION HOUSE  OFF THE PRESBYTERIAN SCHOOL.
MY LIFE REVOLVED  ONLY AROUND A MISSION HOUSE  
 AND THE CHURCH,  
 SCHOOL, CHURCH, YOU KNOW.
AND I REMEMBER THAT AS A KID,  PRE-KINDERGARTEN,  
 I WAS INTRIGUED BY WRITINGS  ON THE DOORS OF OFFICES,  
 YOU KNOW, OR EVEN CLASSROOMS,  
 YOU KNOW, THAT I SAW AROUND ME.
AND I USED TO SIT DOWN  AND TRY TO  
 EMULATE, YOU KNOW,  THOSE WRITINGS.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT,  BUT, UH  
 AND I REMEMBER  THAT THE LETTER "G"   
 WAS MORE INTRIGUING TO ME  THAN ALL OTHERSALL OF  
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY.
MAYBE BECAUSE IT HAS  SO MANY APPENDAGES OR  
 IT'S NOT LIKE "C" OR THE OTHERS.
IT'S A "C"  WITH SOMETHING ELSE ON IT.
YOU KNOW,  IT WAS INTRIGUING TO ME.
I WENT TO ART SCHOOL IN GHANA,  
 WHICH WAS AN OFFSHOOT  
 OF THE GOLDSMITHS ART SCHOOL  IN LONDON.
AT THE TIME I WENT  TO UNIVERSITY,  
 I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANYBODY  WHO WAS LIVING AS AN ARTIST.
YOU KNOW,  YOU KNEW ABOUT ART TEACHERS.
I MET ART TEACHERS  IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL.
BUT THERE WERE MORE TEACHERS  THAN ARTISTS, YOU KNOW.
AND THEN I WAS WONDERING  HOW ONE WAS GOING TO BE  
 AN ARTIST  LIVING PURELY ON ART.
WE KNEW ABOUT DOCTORS.
WE KNEW ABOUT LAWYERS.
I CONSTANTLY KEPT THINKING,  
 "WHAT PRECISELY DO YOU DO  AS AN ARTIST?"
I THINK THAT HAS HELPED  FOCUS ME A LOT, YOU KNOW,  
 AT LEAST TO CONCENTRATE  ON THE PRACTICE OF ART  
 AND SEE WHAT I CAN  GET OUT OF IT.
AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,  
 I DO NOT PROVIDE  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS  
 FOR MY WORKS.
THERE'S NO ONE PARTICULAR WAY  
 THAT THESE ARE  SUPPOSED TO BE INSTALLED.
- SO TO THE LEFT  A LITTLE BIT.
RIGHT THERE.
ALL RIGHT, SPEAR AWAY.
- SINCE THEY ARE SO FREE  AND SO LOOSE AND SO FLEXIBLE,  
 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT  TO HAVE A SPECIFIC FORMAT  
 FOR ANY ONE OF THEM AT ANYTIME.
- I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER SPACE  THAT I CAN HIT.
- AMANDA?
- YEAH?
- OKAY IF WE START  SNIPPING THE TIES OFF?
- I THINK IT IS, YEAH.
- OKAY.
YEAH.
START SNIPPING THOSE TIES.
WHEN THEY LIFT THAT BAR OUT,  
 YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO LIFT UP  THE WORK, YEAH.
- WE'RE GOOD.
LIFT UP THE BAR.
[ tool whirring ]  
 - STRESSED WORLDIS THE TITLE  THAT I GIVE MY CURRENT WORK.
YEAH, I WANT TO CREATE SOME...
SOME CRAZY HERE.
- YEAH.
- YEAH.
OKAY.
OKAY.
OKAY.
THERE ARE SO MANY CONFLICTS  GOING ON IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,  
 MAN-MADE CONFLICTS,  NATURAL CONFLICTS:  
 EARTHQUAKES, TSUNAMIS, WARS.
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ALL THESE  
 LEAVE YOU IN A STATE OF  KIND OF SIEGE.
YEAH, YOUR MIND  IS IN A STATE OF SIEGE.
I THINK IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S NICE.
[ metal clinking ]  
 - BE CAREFUL OF YOUR WRISTS,  MAN.
- THE MEDIA I'VE WORKED WITH  SO FAR HAVE BEEN  
 METAL, CERAMIC,  AND WOOD IN DIFFERENT FORMS.
WORKING WITH STRIPS OF WOOD,  
 I CHANGED MY APPROACH  A LITTLE BIT,  
 YOU KNOW, BY WORKING NOT WITH  STRIPS OF WOOD THAT'S PROCESSED,  
 BUT THEN WOOD  WHICH HAS BEEN USED BY HUMANS...  
 AND THEN TRANSFORM  IT INTO SOMETHING   
 THAT YOU CONTEMPLATE,  
 NOT SOMETHING YOU USE.
I LIKE THE DRAPE OF THAT.
OKAY, SALLY, I WANT SOME  RELAXATION IN SOME PLACES,  
 AND, YEAH.
- IT'S DIFFERENT EVERY TIME.
- YEAH, EVERY TIME  IT'S DIFFERENT.
THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.
SUPPOSED TO CHANGE  WITH EVERY VENUE  
 AND EVERY SPACE.
THE CERAMIC PCES BELONG  TO A SERIES THAT I DID.
IT WAS CALLED BROKEN POTS.
IN MOST PARTS OF AFRICA,  WHEN A POT IS BROKEN,  
 IT'S NOT THE END OF ITS LIFE.
THIS IDEA OF REGENERATION,  
 YOU KNOW,  GIVING FORM TO NEW LIFE,  
 BRINGING ABOUT NEW HOPE,  YOU KNOW.
AND I DID THESE PCES  AT THE TIME THAT ALSO  
 ALREADY IN NIGERIA.
AND THE ECONOMY OF GHANA  WAS REALLY AT ITS LOWEST POINT.
YOU KNOW, AND I THOUGHT THAT  THAT WAS MY OWN WAY  
 OF AFFIRMING SOMETHING POSITIVE,  
 DESTRUCTION AS A PREREQUISITE  FOR NEW IDEAS OR FOR NEW GROWTH.
WHEN I STARTED WORKING  WITH THE BOTTLE CAPS,  
 I WAS PURELY DOING SCULPTURE.
AND SOMEHOW, INADVERTENTLY,  
 THE COLOR SCHEME  OF THE BOTTLE CAPS  
 HAPPENED TO REPLICATE THAT OF  A VERY POPULAR FABRIC IN GHANA,  
 THE KENTE CLOTH.
COLORS OF KENTE CLOTH  ARE TRADITIONALLY  
 THE REDS, THE BLACKS,  THE Ã©LOWS.
THAT CREATED PROBLEMS,  
 BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE START  LOOKING AT IT AS TEXTILES,  
 THE TENDENCY IS FOR THEM TO STOP  
 LOOKING FOR ANY MEANING  BEYOND THAT.
WHAT ARE BOTTLE CAPS?
LIQUOR.
HOW DID LIQUOR  COME INTO MY CULTURE?
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
THREE CONTINENTS  HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH  
 THE INITIAL IDEAS THAT I HAD  ABOUT BOTTLE CAPS.
WHEN THE EUROPEAN TRADERS CAME  TO AFRICA FOR THE FIRST TIME,  
 THEY BROUGHT ITEMS  TO TRADE WITH,  
 THINGS LIKE DRINK,  
 BECAUSE, EVENTUALLY,  
 DRINKS WERE EXCHANGED FOR SLAVES  WHO WERE BROUGHT TO AMERICA  
 TO GROW MORE COTTON  AND SUGARCANE  
 TO MAKE MORE DRINK  AND THEN SHIP TO EUROPE.
SO THE IDEA OF THREE CONTINENTS,  YOU KNOW,  
 AND HOW DRINK WAS A LINK FACTOR  BETWEEN THE THREE.
WHEN I STARTED WORKING  WITH THESE BOTTLE CAPS,  
 I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE  A VERY SHORT RUN.
THEN AS TIME WENT ON,  
 I SAW THAT THE POSSIBILITIES  ARE JUST ENDLESS.
INITIALLY, I WASN'T  CONCERNED WITH COLOR.
NOW I'M CONCERNED WITH COLOR  LIKE A PAINTER.
EVEN THE MODES OF DISPLAY,  THEY ARE BEGINNING TO EXPAND.
THEY HAPPEN TO BE DISPLAYED  PREDOMINANTLY ON THE WALL.
[ laughs ]  
 BUT IT COULD BE ON ANYTHING.
IT COULD BE ON THE FLOOR.
I'VE SHOWED A COUPLE OF THEM  ON HEDGES, YOU KNOW, ON PLANTS.
YOU KNOW,  THE CONCERNS OF A SCULPTOR  
 AND THE CONCERNS OF A PAINTER  
 ARE INHERENT  IN EACH OF THE WORKS THAT I DO.
I WENT TO NIGERIA  BECAUSE I HAD AN APPOINTMENT  
 TO TEACH IN THE UNIVERSITY.
I'VE LIVED IN NIGERIA  ABOUT 36 YEARS NOW.
MY ASSISTANTS ARE YOUNG MEN  
 FROM AROUND THE VICINITY  OF THE STUDIO.
BASICALLY, THESE ARE PEOPLE  WHO JUST FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL  
 AND AWAITING  ENTRY INTO UNIVERSITY.
IT TAKES QUITE SOME TIME  
 FOR PEOPLE TO PASS  THE UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAM.
AND SO WHILE THEY ARE WAITING  AND PREPARING FOR THAT DAY,  
 FIND TIME TO HELP ME  IN THE STUDIO  
 AND EARN SOMEA LIVING.
PROBABLY BECAUSE I PAY SO WELL  
 THAT A LOT OF THEM DO COME  TO ASK WHETHER THEY COULD HELP.
ANYBODY I BRING IN HAS TO  UNDERGO SOME BASIC TRAINING  
 ON HOW TO STITCH  THE PCES TOGETHER,  
 SOME BASIC SKILLS.
THE WHOLE PROCESS  AND END PRODUCT  
 ALL HAVE TO DO WITH FREEDOM,  FLEXIBILITY, YOU KNOW.
SO RIGHT FROM THE INSTRUCTIONS  THEY, YOU KNOW  
 YOU LEAVE A LOT OF ROOM  FOR PEOPLE TO PLAY AROUND.
SO THE RESULTING WORK TENDS  TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY IN IT.
BASICALLY, I WORK IN THIS WAY  THAT  
 WHERE I PICK A MEDIUM  OR A PROCESS,  
 AND I WORK WITH IT  FOR A LONG PERIOD, YEARS.
AND IT HAS TO TAKE SOMETHING  MORE POWERFUL OR MORE DEMANDING  
 TO REALLY TAKE ME AWAY FROM IT.
AT THE BACK OF MY MIND,  
 I'M SERIOUSLY LOOKING OUT  FOR ANYTHING  
 THAT CAN COME AND DISPLACE THIS.
[ laughs ]  
 BUT IT WOULD TAKE SOMETHING  REALLY STRONG TO DO THAT,  
 BECAUSE I FIND THAT EACH DAY  
 I GO INTO HANDLE  THESE BOTTLE CAPS,  
 THEY KEEP GENERATING  FRESH IDEAS.
I LIVED WITH MY MATERNAL UNCLE  IN A DIFFERENT TOWN  
 FROM WHERE MY FATHER  
 AND THE REST OF MY BROTHERS  AND SISTERS LIVED.
AND SO I HAD  VERY LITTLE EXPOSURE  
 TO THE TEXTILES TRADITION  THAT WAS VERY STRONG WITH THEM.
AND IN ART SCHOOL,  
 WE WERE INTRODUCED  TO ALL THE AREAS OF ART.
AND THE ONE THAT LEAST  ATTRACTED ME WAS TEXTILES.
YOU KNOW?
[ laughs ]  
 BUT THENI FIND IT INTRIGUING  THAT WHAT I DO NOW IS VERY MUCH  
 ALIGNED TOLIKE ME TRYING  TO GET AWAY FROM TEXTILES,  
 BUT TEXTILES IS FOLLOWING  [ laughs ]  
 FOLLOWING ME.
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THE IDEA OF RECYCLE,  YOU KNOW,  
 I'VE ALWAYS KICKED AGAINST IT.
RECYCLING HAS TO DO  WITH THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS,  
 AND THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO.
I DON'T, FOR INSTANCE,  RETAIN THE BOTTLE CAPS  
 BACK AS BOTTLE CAPS.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, A NEW LIFE.
AND MAKE THEM NOT OBJECTS  THAT DO SOMETHING UTILITARIAN,  
 BUT OBJECTS OF CONTEMPLATION.
[ metal clinking ]  
 HERE WE GO.
COME AROUND HERE LIKE THIS.
GO LIKE THAT.
OKAY, IT'S A VERY LONG  [ laughs ]  
 IT'S A VERY LONG ROUTE.
OKAY, SO LET'S START FROM HERE.
ACTUALLY, THE RIVER  SHOULD BE EMPTYING OUT.
AND THEN THE SOURCE SHOULD BE  - COMING OUT  
 - IN THE MIDDLE OF, YEAH.
SO THIS ONE'S COME.
THIS IS CALLED DIGITAL RIVER.
AND IT'S COMPOSED OF DIGITS,  YOU KNOW.
AND SO IT COMPELS ONE TO ALWAYS  TRY TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT.
THIS WAY.
IT SHOULD BEGIN TO SWING BACK...  YEAH.
SO THAT IT WOULD END  MAYBE SOMEWHERE HERE.
THE RIVERS FLOW.
THEY DO CHANGE THEIR COURSE.
AND YOU KNOW,  THEY CUT OUT OXBOW LAKES.
AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND  
 YOU KNOW, I THINK MY WORK HAS  PRINCIPALLY BEEN ABOUT CHANGE,  
 YOU KNOW,  AND NONFIXITY OF THINGS.
YOU KNOW,  THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE THERE,  
 AND THEY HAVE TO GROW OLD  AND CHANGE  
 AND DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS,  YOU KNOW.
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M OLD NOW.
[ laughs ]  
 - SOUND WORK OKAY BACK THERE?
IT IS A BITTERSWEET HONOR TO  WELCOME ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY  
 TO CELEBRATE A REMARKABLE PCE  OF PUBLIC ART  
 BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S  MOST CREATIVE  
 AND COURAGEOUS PUBLIC CITIZENS,  AI WEIWEI.
AI WEIWEI COULD NOT BE  WITH US HERE FOR THIS UNVEILING  
 OF HIS LATEST WORK,  
 CIRCLE OF ANIMALS/ZODIAC HEADS.
EVEN THOUGH HE COULD NOT  BE WITH US PHYSICALLY,  
 HE CONTINUES TO SPEAK TO US,  TO DELIGHT US,  
 TO CHALLENGE US THROUGH HIS ART.
IN ITS SCALE AND ACCESSIBILITY,  
 CIRCLES OF ANIMALS/ZODIAC HEADS  
 FOLLOWS IN NEW YORK CITY'S  PROUD TRADITION  
 OF PRESENTING  UNFORGETTABLE PUBLIC ART  
 THAT EVERYONE CAN ENJOY.
AI WEIWEI BELIEVES  THAT ART SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE.
AND WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
- WE CALL HIM, IN CHINESE... [ speaking Chinese ]  
 WHICH IS TEACHER AI.
AND HE'S ALWAYS VERY CONSCIOUS THAT  
 IF WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOMETHING NEW.
FOR EVERY PROJECT HE WANTS  TO MAKE SURE THAT  
 THERE'S LEARNING INVOLVED.
AND IT'S NOT JUST, YOU KNOW,  DOING ANY MENIAL TASK.
- HE GIVES A LOT OF FREEDOM,  ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW.
HE'S NOT THE KIND OF ARTIST  
 THAT IMPOSES  HIS CREATIVE DECISIONS  
 ON HIS ASSISTANTS AND COWORKERS  TO BE EXECUTED, YOU KNOW.
- WELL,  WITH ANY PROPOSAL WE GET,  
 WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO WEIWEI  IS THE SPACE  
 AND HOW HE CAN USE THE SPACE.
HE HAS A LOT OF CRAFTSMEN  
 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE  WORKING WITH HIM.
AS HE WORKS DIRECTLY WITH US,  HE WORKS DIRECTLY WITH THEM.
- THE STUDIO ALWAYS USED TO BE  IN A STATE OF CONSTANT FLUX,  
 YOU KNOW,  ALWAYS MANY PEOPLE COMING,  
 ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST  COUPLE OF YEARS,  
 THAT WE CALL VOLUNTEERS.
YOU KNOW, THEY COME  FOR A CERTAIN KIND OF INTEREST.
MOSTLY CHINESE,  MOSTLY YOUNG PEOPLE.
OFTEN ARE NOT RELATED  TO ART AT ALL, YOU KNOW.
WE HAVE HOUSEWIVES  REALLY COMING TO OUR PLACE  
 AND TELLING WEIWEI  
 THAT THEY THINK HIS WORK  HAS SOME KIND OF MEANING  
 AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE  A PART OF IT.
AND USUALLY, HE JUST  
 HE FEELS LIKE  THAT THERE'S ENOUGH PASSION  
 TO GO THIS WAY,  AND HE ACCEPTS IT, YOU KNOW,  
 - EVERY DAY PEOPLE  ARE COMING UP TO US  
 AND GIVING US PROPOSALS  
 OF SOMETHING THEY CAN DO  TO HELP WEIWEI.
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST WE THOUGHT,  
 "OKAY, MAYBE WE SHOULD  STAY QUIET A BIT,  
 BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO UPSET  THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT."
BUT THEN WE THINK,  "WHAT WOULD WEIWEI DO?"
AND HE WOULD PROBABLY MAKE  THE MOST NOISE OF ANYBODY.
SO I THINK WE STILL  
 HE'S STILL VERY CAREFUL  ABOUT WHAT HE DOES.
HE DOESN'T JUST MAKE NOISE  TO MAKE IT.
SO I THINK WE'RE THINKING  
 WE'RE TRYING TO THINK  VERY CLEARLY  
 ABOUT THE RIGHT APPROACH,  
 BUT I DON'T THINK WE THINK  THE RIGHT WAY IS TO BE QUIET.
- THAT'S TRUE.
DON'T BE QUIET.
- IT'S SAD NOT TO SEE HIM,  
 BECAUSE HE'S A VERY ENTERTAINING  AND VERY CHARISMATIC FIGURE.
HE'S GOOD TO BE AROUND.
IT'S BEEN VERY STRANGE, OBVIOUSLY,  
 INSTALLING A SHOW WITHOUT THE ARTIST.
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY, THAT'S A PREREQUISITE.
AND YOU REALLY WAIT FOR THE ARTIST TO COME.
OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE OUR OWN IDEAS  
 ABOUT HOW TO USE THE GALLERY  AND WHAT WE WANT,  
 BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS  TO CHANGE.
WE DECIDED  TO PUT THE POSTERS UP,  
 BECAUSE NORMALLY,  AN ARTIST IS HERE,  
 AND WE HAD ARRANGED INTERVIEWS,  
 AND WE WOULD EXPECT HIM  TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK.
SO WE THOUGHT THAT ACTUALLY  GETTING HIS VOICE OUT THERE  
 WAS IMPORTANT.
AND WE JUST CHOSE  A SMALL SELECTION  
 OF VERY PERTINENT,  TIMELESS QUOTES.
AS IS WELL-KNOWN,  
 AI WEIWEI IS THE SON  OF A VERY FAMOUS POET, AI QING.
HE GREW UP KNOWING THAT ART  
 WAS BOTH VERY POWERFUL  AND VERY CONTROVERSIAL.
HE KIND OF RAN AWAY FROM THAT  
 AND RAN AWAY FROM CHINA  IN THE LATE '80s  
 AND WENT TO NEW YORK,  
 HAD A PERIOD OF,  I GUESS, REFLECTION  
 AND ABSORBING THINGS.
HE WAS MAKING WORK,  
 BUT HE WASN'T REALLY PURSUING  A STRONG CAREER AS AN ARTIST.
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW,  THOSE TWO INFLUENCES  
 WHEN HE FINALLY CAME BACK  TO CHINA IN THE MID '90s  
 REALLY SET HIM UP  TO TAKE A STAND  
 AND ENTER THE CHINESE  CULTURAL WORLD AND ART WORLD  
 WITH A VERY STRONG VOICE.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WORKS  IN THE SHOW THAT, FOR ME,  
 ARE VERY IMPORTANT  AND VERY POIGNANT.
THERE'S THE SECURITY CAMERA,  WHICH IS MADE IN MARBLE,  
 AND WE'RE PRESENTING  ON A PLINTH.
YOU KNOW, SECURITY CAMERAS  ARE VERY PREVALENT FOR  
 IN ALL OF OUR LIVES.
THEY KIND OF ARE  THE BACKGROUND TO OUR LIVES.
AND WE TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED.
FOR HIM, IT WAS VERY PRESENT.
IT WASN'T JUST  IN THE BACKGROUND,  
 BUT HE WAS, YOU KNOW,  
 SPECIFICALLY UNDER SURVEILLANCE  FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.
HE, IN ONE WAY,  TOOK THAT QUITE LIGHTLY.
HE WASHE WOULD CHAT  TO THE SECURITY GUARDS,  
 SORT OF PLAINCLOTHES  PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME  
 AND STAND OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE.
AND HE'S SORT OF SHAKE  THEIR HANDS AND  
 YOU KNOW,  HE WAS QUITE RELAXED WHEN  
 WE SAID,  "ISN'T THIS DISTURBING?"
BUT, OBVIOUSLY,  IT IS DISTURBING.
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED  HAS BEEN TERRIBLE.
THE OTHER THING  THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT  
 IS THATWHY HE'S MADE  THIS KIND OF MONUMENT  
 IN MARBLE  OF A SECURITY CAMERA.
HE ADOPTED ANOTHER STRATEGY,  
 WHICH WAS TO PUT HIS LIFE  IN AS PUBLIC A VIEW AS POSSIBLE.
WHEN I WENT TO SEE HIM  IN THE STUDIO,  
 HE TWEETED, YOU KNOW, 20 TIMES  
 DURING OUR FIRST  HOUR-LONG MEETING.
AND I GUESS THE PRINCIPLE IS  THAT AS LONG AS  
 EVERYTHING IS OUT IN THE OPEN,  
 THERE'S NOTHING TO SPY ON.
SO HE HAD NOTHING TO HIDE,  ACTUALLY.
HE WORKS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.
BUT EACH ONE OF THOSE WAYS,  HE USES IN ITS OWN TERMS  
 AND AS SIMPLY AND CLEARLY  AND STRONGLY AS POSSIBLE  
 TO GIVE TESTIMONY  TO THE WORLD HE'S LIVING IN.
[ indistinct conversation ]  
 [ cat meows ]  
 - HOW DID YOU DECIDE  TO BECOME AN ARTIST?
- UH, HOW?
THE DECISION IS NOT MADE VERY  
 I SHOULD SAY NOT VERY SERIOUSLY.
I MEAN, THIS IS A  
 THERE'S NOT MUCH CHOICE THERE  WHEN I STARTED TO DO ART.
YOU'RE EITHER NON-ARTIST,  
 WHICH MEANS YOU CAN BE A WORKER,  FARMER, OR SOLDIER.
OR YOU BECOME SOMEBODY WHO,  
 AT THAT TIME, WHAT WE WOULD CALL  ART WORKER, YOU KNOW.
SO SINCE  I'M A BIT FAMILIAR WITH ART  
 BECAUSE MY FATHER,  
 SO I JUST PICKED UP THIS.
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,  NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL.
YOU KNOW, I SPENT YEARS...  
 MM, I CALL MYSELF AN ARTIST,  BUT NOT REALLY.
I DON'T HAVE MANY WORKS  
 OR NOTHING PEOPLE  WOULD APPRECIATE  
 TILL VERY LATE, YOU KNOW,  2004, I START TO HAVE SHOWS.
AND...WHICH SURPRISED ME ALSO,  YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE ALWAYS SOMEONE.
YOU'RE CAPABLE TO BE OR  
 YOU KNOW, WELL, THEY SAY  YOU CAN MAKE CHANDELIERS,  
 YOU ARE A CHANDELIER MAKER.
AND IT'S VERY CONVINCING.
I MEAN, IT'S MORE CONVINCING  THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME  POLITICAL ACTIVIST, I GUESS.
ACTUALLY, I NEVER REALLY  RETHINK ABOUT MY WORK.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALREADY PASSED.
IT'S A CROOKED COFFIN.
I THINK, YEAH,  YOU CAN USE IT AS A TABLE TOO,  
 TO TAKE A NAP OR SOMETHING.
THE MEDIA IS THE MESSAGE.
I MEAN, IN MANY CASES,  WHICH IS TRUE,  
 NOT, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,  IN THE CLASSIC SENSE.
IT CARRIES THE FULL INTENTION  AND THE MEANING.
ONCE YOU CHANGE IT,  IT'S SO VERY DISTURBING.
YEAH, THOSE ARE  REALLY ARE USELESS OBJECTS.
I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED  
 IN THIS SO-CALLED  USELESS OBJECT.
I MEAN, YOU  IT TAKES PERFECT CRAFTSMANSHIP,  
 BEAUTIFUL MATERIAL,  
 AND CAREFULLY MEASURED  AND CRAFTED.
BUT THE SAME TIME,  IT'S REALLY USELESS.
I MEAN...  
 YOU NEED SOMETHING  PEOPLE CAN REALIZE IS ART.
YOU KNOW, OTHERWISE,  THEY THINK YOU ARE TOO POLITICAL  
 OR YOU'RE TOOYOU'RE  
 "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S NOT ART."
OR "YOU'LL NEVER GET IT,"  YOU KNOW.
SO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SAY,  "OH, I'M AN ARTIST."
YOU KNOW.
"I CAN DO THIS."
[ laughs ]  
 I THINK I'M INTERESTED  IN THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY,  
 SO-CALLED ARTIST,  
 ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS  DEALING WITH NEW POSSIBILITIES.
THE AUDIO COMPONENT OF THIS  HARVARD BACKPACK INSTALLATION  
 IS THE READING  OF THE 5,000 NAMES  
 OF THE DEAD STUDENTS  VICTIMIZED BY THE EARTHQUAKE.

 MY CARPENTERS ALWAYS NEED JOB.
THEY ALWAYS SAY,  "WEIWEI, WHAT NEXT WE CAN DO?"
SO II REALLY HAVE  NO IDEAS WHAT  
 YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A  
 I DON'T HAVE SO MUCH IDEAS.
I SAID,  "THEN MAYBE WE TRY THIS BALL."
IT COME FROM PLASTIC PET TOY.
AND THEY SAID,  "THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT."
SO I SAID,  "OKAY, THAT'S THE PURPOSE."
SO IT TAKE THEM, LIKE,  A YEAR OR SO, YOU KNOW,  
 TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO  
 MAKE THIS STRUCTURE  WITHOUT NAILS.
GRADUALLY,  IT BECOME A GAME FOR THEM.
AND THEY REALLY LOVE IT.
EVENIT'S HAVE NO PURPOSE,  BUT THEY ACCEPT IT,  
 BECAUSE SO DIFFICULT.
YEAH, I MEAN, SURVEILLANCE  HAS A VERY CLEAR MEANING.
IT'S TO MONITOR, YOU KNOW  
 OR SECRETLYSECRETLY MONITOR  PEOPLE'S BEHAVING OR...
BUT ONCE IT'S BECOME MARBLE,  
 IT'S ONLY BEING WATCHED.
IT'S NOT FUNCTIONING ANYMORE,  YOU KNOW.
