 - SO OFTEN, PEOPLE SAY,  "I GET YOUR MESSAGE,"  
 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MESSAGE  
 IS SO SEPARATED  FROM WHAT THE OBJECT IS.
- PEOPLE ARE POSSESSIVE  ABOUT HISTORY.
THEY ALWAYS  WANT SOMETHING FROM IT,  
 WANTING TO MANIPULATE  THE HISTORY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
- PERFORMANCE IS A TOOL  HOW I CAN EXPRESS MYSELF.
AND I THINK, IN A LIFE  OF AN ARTIST,  
 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT  TO FIND THE RIGHT TOOL.
[ horn honking ]  
 - I'M AN ARTIST BECAUSE THE  NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS  
 USED TO GIVE GRANTS  TO INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS.
SO I GOT A GRANT  FOR DRAWING IN 1989.
THAT GRANT ALLOWED ME  TO MAKE A DECISION,  
 WHICH WAS, I COULD KEEP WORKING  THE JOB THAT I WAS WORKING  
 40, 50 HOURS A WEEK,  
 OR I COULD USE THAT GRANT MONEY  TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF  
 AND REALLY DIVE  INTO THIS THING CALLED  
 BEING AN ARTIST.
AND SO THAT GRANT  WAS PIVOTAL, ACTUALLY.
- INVITES, PLEASE.
- I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS PARTY.
LIKE...  
 - IT'S FINE.
- OKAY.
- IT'S ALL GOOD.
- [ laughs ]  
 - IT'S ALL GOOD.
- EVERYBODY WANTS TO COME  TO THIS PARTY ALL OF A SUDDEN.
- WE'RE GONNA, LIKE...  
 - ONE OF THE THINGS  
 ABOUT HAVING A RETROSPECTIVE  AT THE WHITNEY  
 IS THAT I FEEL  LIKE I AM COMING TO A PLACE  
 THAT I KNOW VERY WELL,  
 BECAUSE THE WHITNEY  HAS THE LARGEST COLLECTION  
 OF MY WORK IN THE COUNTRY.
I STARTED SHOWING AT THE WHITNEY  IN 1991, IN THE BIENNIAL.
I KNOW ALL THE GUARDS,  AND I KNOW ALL THE CURATORS.
AND SO IT'S A VERY EASY PLACE  TO NAVIGATE.
TODAY I WAS, LIKE, AWFUL.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT,  
 BUT YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED  YOUR CELL NUMBER?
- NO, NO, IT'S THE SAME.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- ANY OPENING OF AN EXHIBITION  IS A BIT LIKE  
 THIS IS YOUR LIFE.
SO THERE WERE PEOPLE  THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN 30 YEARS.
- I'M SO PROUD OF YOU,  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
LOTS OF FAMILY  AND LOTS OF ARTIST FRIENDS.
- I MEAN, THE LINE IS OUTSIDE...  
 - WE ONLY JUST GLANCE  FROM ROOM TO ROOM.
- I KNOW, WE HAVE TO HAVE  A PICTURE, A PICTURE TIME.
- PICTURE TIME.
[ laughs ]  
 I WON'T SAY  IT WAS FUN TO BE THERE,  
 BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THAT LEVEL  OF SCRUTINY AND ATTENTION.
BUT I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING  
 TO BE AROUND SO MANY PEOPLE  WHO WISHED ME WELL.
THE SURPRISE OF A RETROSPECTIVE  IS THAT THERE'S MORE CONSISTENCY  
 THAN I HAD THOUGHT  IN HOW THE WORK APPEARS.
THERE ARE SEVERAL THREADS  THAT TIE TOGETHER THE SHOW.
ONE IS AN INTEREST  THROUGHOUT THE WORK  
 IN ISSUES OF LEGIBILITY  AND ILLEGIBILITY.
I'VE USED LANGUAGE  IN VARIOUS KINDS OF WAYS  
 THROUGHOUT MY CAREER.
ANOTHER IS CONCERN  WITH AMERICAN HISTORY.
ANOTHER THING  IS THE RETURN TO COLOR.
AND IT IS AT  THE VERY BEGINNING OF MY CAREER,  
 THE EARLIEST WORKS IN THE SHOW,  
 BUT IT RETURNS  TOWARDS THE END AS WELL.
I DIDN'T REALLY DO DRAWINGS  WHEN I WAS A KID.
I MADE COPIES OF THINGS.
SO I WOULDI HAD A GOOD  BUSINESS WHEN I WAS A KID  
 DOING DRAWINGS OF CARTOON  CHARACTERS FROM THE NEWSPAPER.
AND I WOULD CUT THEM OUT  AND SELL THEM  
 TO MY FRIENDS IN SCHOOL.
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,  
 I KNEW THAT I WANTED  TO BE AN ARTIST.
AND MY MOTHER HAD SENT ME  TO AFTER-SCHOOL CLASSES  
 AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM.
AND I THINK MY MOTHER  SENT ME TO ART CLASSES  
 BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT'S  WHAT A WELL-ROUNDED CITIZEN  
 SHOULD HAVE EDUCATION IN,  
 SORT OF ARTS IN A GENERAL SENSE.
BUT THERE WAS NO ONE  IN MY FAMILY  
 WHO HAD BEEN AN ARTIST  
 AND SO THERE WASN'T REALLY  ANY ROLE MODEL FOR IT.
I THINK THE IDEA  THAT I ACTUALLY  
 WAS GOING TO BE AN ARTIST  HORRIFIED HER,  
 BECAUSE ARTISTS  DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY.
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY?
THE ONLY ARTISTS  I'VE EVER HEARD OF ARE DEAD.
AND SHE MEANT PICASSO.
I THINK THE ARTIST  THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN  
 WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING  
 WERE DE KOONING, FRANZ KLINE,  JACKSON POLLOCK.
THAT WHOLE GENERATION  OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISTS.
AT A CERTAIN MOMENT,  I DECIDED THAT BEING  
 AN ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST  WASN'T QUITE GOING TO DO IT,  
 AND THAT PRODUCED A KIND OF  CRISIS IN THE STUDIO.
AND WHAT I DECIDED TO DO  WAS TO INCORPORATE THE THINGS  
 THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT,  THE THINGS I WAS READING,  
 INTO THE WORK DIRECTLY.
AND THE MODELS FOR THAT  
 WERE PEOPLE LIKE JASPER JOHNS  OR RAUSCHENBERG.
PEOPLE WHO USED TEXT  IN THEIR WORK.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING THAT,  
 I DECIDED THAT I WAS JUST  GOING TO USE MY HANDWRITING.
AND THEN AFTER A WHILE,  I DECIDED I'M NOT INTERESTED  
 IN TELLING MY OWN STORIES.
I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT  OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG  WITH SELF-EXPRESSION.
IT JUST HAS ITS LIMITS.
[ chuckles ]  
 AND I THINK THAT THE THINGS  THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN  
 WERE ALREADY IN THE WORLD,  AND SO THEY DIDN'T NEED ME  
 TO CREATE THEM AGAIN  IN THAT WAY.
THEY JUST NEEDED FOR ME  TO HAVE THEM  
 BE BROUGHT INTO THE WORK,  YOU KNOW.
THE WORK BECAME  MORE ABOUT QUOTATION,  
 USING TEXTS  FROM VARIOUS LITERARY SOURCES.
I READ LOTS OF THINGS.
I READ WHATEVER  I FEEL LIKE READING.
AND IF SOMETHING  STAYS IN MY HEAD LONG ENOUGH,  
 IT MIGHT TURN INTO ART.
IT WAS THE ONE THING  THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD  
 MY MOTHER WOULD ALLOW ME:  ANY BOOK I WANTED,  
 NO MATTER THE COST.
EXPENSIVE TOYS OR CLOTHES, NO.
BUT ANY BOOK.
SO THAT KIND  OF ATTENTION TO BOOKS  
 WASLOVE OF BOOKS  CAME EARLY.
IDEAS TAKE A LONG TIME  TO BE BORN, YOU KNOW.
THEY TAKE A LONG TIME  TO GESTATE.
THEY TAKE A LONG TIME  TO COME INTO THE WORLD.
AND THAT PROCESS IS HARD.
GLOVES ON.
I GUESS WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO  
 ISI DON'T KNOW  NOT LOVE OF PAINTING  
 BUT LOVE OF THE IDEA  OF MAKING IDEAS.
FIRST TEXT PAINTINGS I MADE  WERE SINGLE SENTENCES  
 BY AN AUTHOR NAMED  ZORA NEALE HURSTON,  
 AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN,  
 A WRITER  OF THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE.
THE WAY I WAS  MAKING THE PAINTINGS  
 WAS TO USE PLASTIC LETTER  STENCILS AND OIL CRAYONS.
IF YOU'RE USING LETTER STENCILS,  
 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING  WITH A SHARP BOUNDARY,  
 BUT OIL CRAYONS WANT TO  BREAK OUT OF THOSE BOUNDARIES.
THEY'RE MESSY,  THEY DON'T KEEP THEIR SHAPE.
AND FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS,  I THINK, I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT  
 HOW TO MAKE THESE OIL CRAYONS  MAKE NICE, NEAT LETTERS.
AND THEN I REALIZED  THAT THE FACT  
 THAT THEY DIDN'T MAKE  NICE, NEAT LETTERS  
 WAS ACTUALLY  MUCH MORE INTERESTING.
SMUDGING THEM AND TRANSFORMING  THESE LETTERS INTO ABSTRACTION  
 WAS WHAT THE PAINTINGS  WERE ABOUT,  
 BUT IT TOOK SIX MONTHS  TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
[ chuckles ]  YOU KNOW?
AT FIRST IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT  FOR ME THAT I MADE THESE,  
 YOU KNOW, FROM START TO FINISH.
NOW THAT'S NOT  SO IMPORTANT TO ME.
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT  I COME IN AT A CERTAIN POINT  
 WHERE THERE IS A BASE  FOR ME TO WORK OFF OF.
I FIND IT INTERESTING  TO WORK ON SOMETHING  
 THAT'S SORT OF STARTED  OUT OF MY HANDS BASICALLY.
THE KINDS OF LINE BREAKS  AND KINDS OF SPACING  
 THAT THEY WOULD MAKE  IN PRESENTING A TEXT  
 IS VERY DIFFERENT  THAN WHAT I WOULD DO.
I OFTEN FIND  THAT WHEN I'M WORKING,  
 IT'S THE MISTAKES  
 OR IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S  SUGGESTION OR INTERVENTION  
 THAT PUSHES THE WORK FORWARD,  YOU KNOW?
IT'S THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T  THINK I WAS GOING TO DO  
 THAT END UP BEING THE THING.
AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS  YOU HAVE TO LOSE  
 A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROL  OVER THINGS.
YOU HAVE TO LET THEM  GO TO SOMEONE ELSE,  
 LET SOMEONE ELSE WORK ON THEM,  COLLABORATE WITH PEOPLE.
SO OFTEN PEOPLE SAY,  "I GET YOUR MESSAGE,"  
 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT  MESSAGE, IF I HAVE A MESSAGE,  
 IS SO SEPARATED FROM WHAT  THE OBJECT IS, HOW IT'S PAINTED.
INDEED, THAT'S WHERE  THE WORK STARTS FROM,  
 A KIND OF MAKING  RATHER THAN A MESSAGE  
 THAT IS THEN LAYERED  INTO AN OBJECT.
THERE'S A SERIES OF PAINTINGS  
 CALLED THE COLORING BOOK   PAINTINGS,  
 WHICH WERE BASED  ON KIDS' DRAWINGS.
OFTEN, WHEN I LOOK  FOR SOURCE MATERIAL,  
 I DON'T KNOW  WHERE I'M GOING TO FIND IT,  
 AND SOMETIMES I DON'T EVEN KNOW  WHAT I'M EXACTLY LOOKING FOR.
WHEN I FOUND THESE,  IT WAS QUITE A SURPRISE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY EXISTED.
SO IT'S THE MOMENT  WHEN EDUCATORS  
 ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,  HOW DO YOU TEACH BLACK HISTORY?
SO THEY CREATE THESE  COLORING BOOKS THAT HAVE IMAGES  
 THAT ANY COLORING BOOK  WOULD HAVE IN THEM.
BOYS PLAYING BASKETBALL  
 JUXTAPOSED WITH IMAGES  OF PEOPLE LIKE HARRIET TUBMAN.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE  AN EASY PROJECT FOR ME.
I REALLY HAD TO KIND OF INHABIT  
 THE WAY A KID WOULD HOLD  A CRAYON OR PAINT A PAINTING.
YOU KNOW, PICASSO SAID HE HAD  TO SPEND HIS WHOLE LIFETIME  
 TO LEARN TO DRAW LIKE A CHILD,  
 AND I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS NOW;  IT'S HARD.
[ chuckles ]  
 BUT IT WAS VERY  INSTRUCTIVE FOR ME.
THAT DISCONNECT BETWEEN  
 WHAT THE KIDS IMAGINE  THOSE IMAGES TO BE  
 AND WHAT I AS AN ADULT BRING  TO AN IMAGE OF, SAY, MALCOLM X  
 WAS WHAT THE WORK WAS ABOUT.
I FIRST STARTED DOING NEONS  
 BECAUSE THERE'S A NEON SHOP  IN MY BUILDING.
AND ONE DAY I WAS  WALKING BY THE NEON SHOP  
 AND THE OWNER, MATT,  SAID, "DO YOU WANT A TOUR?"
AND I SAID, "SURE."
HE MAKES WORK FOR CORPORATIONS,  
 BUT HE ALSO MAKES WORK  FOR ARTISTS TOO.
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS  AN INTERESTING PAIRING.
I'D BEEN TO THAT POINT  MAKING PAINTINGS  
 USING BLACK TEXT  ON WHITE BACKGROUNDS.
SO REALLY  JUST AS A JOKE  
 I SAID, "YOU KNOW, IS THERE  SUCH A THING AS BLACK NEON?"
AND THE OWNER  OF THE SHOP, MATT,  
 SAID, "THAT'S AGAINST  THE LAWS OF PHYSICS,  
 BECAUSE BLACK  IS THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT."
BUT THEN WE STARTED  TALKING ABOUT IT A BIT,  
 AND I REALIZED  THAT THERE WAS A WAY TO DO IT,  
 BECAUSE ONE CAN TAKE  A NEON TUBE  
 AND SIMPLY PAINT IT BLACK  ON THE FRONT.
SO IT WOULD READ AS A BLACK  LETTER OR A LINE,  
 BUT WOULD ALSO READ AS NEON,  
 BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE LIGHT  
 COMING FROM BEHIND  THAT BLACK LETTER.
AND ONCE I REALIZED  THAT WAS POSSIBLE,  
 IT BECAME THE CONNECTION  BETWEEN MY PAINTING WORK  
 AND THESE NEONS USING TEXT.
LOTS OF ARTISTS HAVE USED NEON,  
 SO THERE WERE PRECEDENTS  FOR WHAT I WAS DOING.
WAIT, WHAT IS THAT?
OH, SO THIS IS SORT OF  TELLING YOU  
 WHAT THE COLOR'S GOING TO  LOOK LIKE WHEN IT'S LIT INSIDE.
WOW.
HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO PUMP  THE GAS INTO THE LETTERS?
- 10, 15 MINUTES,  20 MINUTES.
THIS IS A NEON GAS.
THIS IS ARGON WITH MERCURY.
DID YOU SEE THE MERCURY?
- YEAH.
- AND THEN THIS IS HELIUM.
- ALL RIGHT.
AND THEN THIS IS ARGON GAS.
ARGON WITH NO MERCURY.
- RIGHT.
- GLENN, YOU'VE BEEN  WORKING WITH NEON,  
 AND YOU NEVER GOT  THE EXPLANATION FOR IT?
- NO, IT JUST KIND OF  ARRIVED DONE.
[ laughs ]  
 IT JUST ARRIVED.
FIRST NEON WAS  BASED ON A LITTLE FRAGMENT  
 OF A GERTRUDE STEIN NOVEL  CALLED THREE LIVES,  
 AND IT SAYS, "NEGRO SUNSHINE."
I WAS INTERESTED  IN GERTRUDE STEIN  
 BECAUSE SHE IS INTERESTED  IN AMERICA, AMERICAN HISTORY,  
 TRYING TO DESCRIBE  WHAT AMERICA MEANS,  
 WHICH I THINK  IS ONE OF MY PROJECTS TOO.
FOR ME, USING NEON  WAS REALLY ABOUT  
 FINDING THE CONNECTION  
 BETWEEN THE WORK  I WAS ALREADY DOING  
 AND THE NEON.
AND UNTIL WE HAD THAT  DISCUSSION ABOUT BLACK LIGHT,  
 THAT HADN'T HAPPENED.
THERE ARE PAINTINGS  THAT EMIT LIGHT.
THE COAL DUST PAINTINGS DO...  
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS SHINY  BLACK GRAVEL-LIKE SUBSTANCE  
 CALLED COAL DUST ON TOP OF THEM.
AND WHEN YOU SHINE A LIGHT  ON THAT,  
 IT SPARKLES AND GLISTENS.
AND I STARTED USING COAL DUST  IN RELATIONSHIP TO PAINTINGS  
 BECAUSE I WAS THINKING  ABOUT JAMES BALDWIN  
 AND THE ESSAY THAT I WAS USING,   STRANGER IN THE VILLAGE.
HE'S AN AMERICAN AUTHOR.
HE'S GONE TO EUROPE  TO WORK ON A NOVEL,  
 AND HE'S IN THIS  LITTLE SWISS VILLAGE.
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE '50s.
AND THE ESSAY IS ABOUT  HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE PEOPLE  
 WHO HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP  TO BLACK AMERICANS.
AND HE'S TRYING TO THINK THROUGH  
 WHAT IT MEANS  TO BE A STRANGER SOMEWHERE.
THE KIND OF FASCINATION AND FEAR  THAT STRANGERS PRODUCE.
I LIKE THE IDEA  OF USING COAL DUST  
 BECAUSE IT'S A WASTE PRODUCT.
IT'S LEFTOVER STUFF  FROM COAL PROCESSING.
THE WAY IT'S USED IN THE  PAINTINGS WAS INTERESTING TO ME  
 AND SEEMED TO BE  A KIND OF PARALLEL  
 TO WHAT BALDWIN  WAS TALKING ABOUT.
IT GETS SPRAYED  WITH THIS ACRYLIC GLUE,  
 'CAUSE OTHERWISE,  ALL THAT COAL DUST  
 IS GONNA FALL OFF  THE DRAWING.
GLUE AND SPRAYERS  DON'T REALLY GO TOGETHER.
SO WHEN IT DRIES,  IT DRIES CLEAR.
BASICALLY FANCY ELMER'S GLUE  AND WATER.
NOTHING VERY MYSTERIOUS.
ET VOILA.
PAINT IS A VERY  SENSUAL MATERIAL.
IT'S LOVELY TO WORK WITH  AND LOVELY TO LOOK AT.
IT'S ALSO INEFFICIENT.
WE'RE USED TO SEEING  TEXT PRINTED.
WE'RE NOT USED TO SEEING  TEXT MADE OUT OF PAINT.
AND THERE'S A KIND  OF SLOWNESS AND INEFFICIENCY  
 ABOUT RENDERING TEXT IN PAINT  THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.
IT SLOWS YOUR READING DOWN.
YOU KNOW, SLOWS THE VIEWER DOWN  IN FRONT OF THE PAINTINGS.
AND I THINK WE'RE IN A WORLD  THAT'S VERY FAST,  
 SO THINGS THAT SLOW YOU  FOR A MINUTE,  
 GIVE YOU PAUSE,  I THINK, ARE GOOD.
IF YOU USE JOKES BY  A COMEDIAN LIKE RICHARD PRYOR,  
 THEY NEED TO BE  JOKES IN COLOR.
SO THE PAINTINGS  HAVE TO HAVE COLOR IN THEM.
THEY ALLOWED ME TO GO BACK TO  MY ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST DAYS  
 WHEN I MADE PAINTINGS  THAT WERE VERY COLORFUL.
- [ laughing ]  
 [ voices overlapping ]  
 WELL, THE STRUGGLE IS ALWAYS  
 THE IDEA YOU HAVE  IN YOUR HEAD  
 ABOUT WHAT YOU  WANT TO SAY IN YOUR WORK  
 VERSUS THE MEANS YOU HAVE  TO SAY IT WITH  
 OR YOUR ABILITIES  OR YOUR SKILLS  
 OR THE TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS  
 OF THE MEDIUM  YOU'RE WORKING IN.
SO IT'STHERE'S ALWAYS  SORT OF, LIKE,  
 THE IDEAL PAINTING IN YOUR HEAD,  AND YOU NEVER QUITE GET TO THAT.
AND SO YOU MAKE SOMETHING,  AND IT'S ALMOST THERE.
IT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.
YOU MAKE SOMETHING ELSE.
IT'S ALMOST THERE.
IT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.
YOU MAKE SOMETHING ELSE.
IT'S ALMOST THERE.
IT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.
BUT THAT PROCESS DOESN'T END,  YOU KNOW?
EVENTUALLY JUST  THAT IS THE PROCESS.
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST KEEP GOING.
- IT WAS A HUGE CHANGE  TO FILM AT EMPAC  
 WITH ANY SORT OF TECHNOLOGICAL  ASSIST YOU COULD WANT.
THE FILM THAT WE DID BEFORE,   YOU MAKE ME ILIAD,  
 WE FILMED PARTLY  IN MY PARENTS' BASEMENT  
 AND PARTLY IN OUR APARTMENT.
WITH A WHITE UNDERSHIRT  AND THIS SHIRT,  
 YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL.
- FANCY PANTS.
- TOTALLY.
SO FOR THIS FILM,  I INVITED MY SISTER ALICE  
 AND ALICE'S HUSBAND, MICAH,  
 AND THEN MY YOUNGEST SISTER,  JULIET.
- BRAINY MCBRAINYTON,  MAXIMILIEN ROBES  
 - MAX-MILLION.
- MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE  
 PERFECTLY MEMORIZED  JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU.
CITIZENS BORED  BY HIS HYPER-VERBOSITY,  
 SHOUTED IN UNISON,   MERDE, SANS CHAPEAU!
- OKAY, YOU KNOW  JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU  
 WAS AN IMPORTANT MUSIC THEORIST?
- YES, I KNOW.
- I FEEL LIKE  I SHOULD SING THIS ONE.
- AND YOU KNOW  WHAT HE DID?
OH, YES, YES, PLEASE.
PLEASE SING IT.
JUST SING.
IMPROVISE RIGHT NOW.
- [ laughs ]  SORRY.
- WE WERE ALWAYS  VERY CREATIVE GROWING UP.
AND A LOT OF WHAT WE DID  GROWING UP  
 I KIND OF SEE IN HER ART NOW.
WE WOULD CREATE  THESE ELABORATE PLAYS  
 THAT WE WOULD PUT ON THAT  MARY, AS THE OLDEST, OF COURSE,  
 WAS ALWAYS THE INSTIGATOR.
- SO TRY SINGING  IN YOUR AWESOME LITTLE TUNE  
 WITH, LIKE, PERFECTLY  MEMORIZED JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU  
 AND CITIZENS BORED, SO, LIKE,  THERE'S A CHANGE IN TONE.
- OKAY.
â™ª  BRAINY MCBRAINYTON  MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE â™ª   
 â™ª  PERFECTLY MEMORIZED  JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU â™ª   
 â™ª  CITIZENS BORED  BY HIS HYPER-VERBOSITY â™ª   
 â™ª  SHOUTED IN UNISON â™ª   
 all: MERDE, SANS CHAPEAU!
- ALICE, SHOW US YOUR  THROAT-SLASHING GESTURE.
- [ grunts ]  
 - YEAH.
- IF I START UP HIGHER  AND CIRCLE BELOW.
- THERE, THAT'S TOTALLY CLEAR.
- SHOULD I BARE MY TEETH?
ARRGH.
- DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
- NO, I'M SAYING,   "MERDE, SANS CHAPEAU!"
- THAT'S GOOD.
THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.
- I THINK ALICE  SHOULD GO LIKE THIS.
- LIKE WHAT?
- CAN'T SEE THE ACTUAL, LIKE,  THROAT-CUTTING.
IT'S JUST THE HAND,  LIKE THIS.
- YEAH.
- YOU THINK I SHOULD  USE MY LEFT HAND INSTEAD?
- ONE MORE?
- YEAH.
- BRAINY MCBRAINYTON,  MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE  
 PERFECTLY MEMORIZED  JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU.
CITIZENS BORED  BY HIS HYPER-VERBOSITY  
 SHOUTED IN UNISON...  
 all: MERDE!
SANS CHAPEAU!
- SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD  AN INTERESTING PART TO PLAY  
 IN THE ENTIRE FAMILY'S  PERSPECTIVES ON LIFE.
WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH,  SHE WAS BRINGING HOME  
 FEMINIST LITERATURE  FOR ME TO READ FROM COLLEGE  
 AND JUST GIVING ME  NEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.
- AND I KIND OF WANT  THE SNOW SHAKERS TO BE UP HIGH.
- HIGH?
LIKE THIS?
- LIKE, STILL ON THE SCREEN,  BUT HIGH.
ARE WE RECORDING?
- YEAH.
- JELLY TART, JELLY TART,  GENERAL BONAPARTE'S  
 SENTIMENTALITY  WORRIED ALL FRANCE.
HE CRIED, SACCHARINE TEARS  ON THE BANKS OF THE VOLGA  
 WHILE WATERLOO WATERWORKS  SPOTTED HIS PANTS.
- THIS IS GONNA BE  A TRICKY TIME FOR YOU GUYS,  
 CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA  HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER  
 AND Ã©L,  "100 VOLTAIRES."
WE'LL GET YOU TO SCOOT...  
 - AND ACTUALLY, I SUGGEST  THAT WE NEED TO START  
 BRINGING OUR HANDS TOGETHER  TO DO THE JACOB'S LADDER BEFORE,  
 SO THAT WHEN THEY  WHEN IT COMES TOGETHER,  
 IT'S, BING,  "100 VOLTAIRES."
I'M AN ENGINEER,  
 SO I HAVE LITTLE  TO NO BACKGROUND IN ART.
AND THEREFORE,  WHEN I SEE MARY'S ARTWORK,  
 IT IS ALWAYS SO DIFFERENT  FROM WHAT I NORMALLY ENCOUNTER  
 THAT IT MAKES ME  THINK A LOT HARDER ABOUT IT.
I THINK WE'LL BE OKAY.
- SO WE'RE NOT  USING AUDIO FOR THIS.
SO JUST...  
 READY TO GO?
- YEAH, I THINKI THINK I AM.
- MARY, COULD  SINCE WE'RE NOT DOING AUDIO,  
 CAN YOU BE LIKE, "AND STOP"?
- YEAH.
- OKAY, I'LL JUST  
 - JUST HISS OR SOMETHING SO YOU  DON'T HAVE TO MOVE YOUR MOUTH.
- OKAY, YEAH.
OKAY.
all: TWINKLE TOE, TWINKLE TOE,  DENIS P. DIDEROT  
 DREAMED OF A GOVERNMENT  LED BY HIS HEIRS.
NIGHTMARES SO GHASTLY,  SO ANTI-ENLIGHTENMENT,  
 GAVE HIM THE SHOCK  OF 100 VOLTAIRES.
- MARY CAME ACROSS THIS MAP.
IT'S THIS OLD MAP OF PARIS,  
 PRE-HAUSSMANN  RENOVATION OF PARIS.
THE DESIGN OF THIS MAP  IS AN INSPIRATION  
 FOR MAKING  SOME OF THE BUILDINGS.
WHAT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD DO  IS TRY TO RE-CREATE  
 SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURE  THAT YOU SEE IN THIS MAP,  
 THIS SORT OF  CARTOON-LIKE ETCHING,  
 HATCH-MARKING ARCHITECTURE,  
 AS THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODELS  
 SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE  THESE OBJECTS  
 AS POSSIBLE  VIRTUAL SET ELEMENTS.
- IT'S SO WILD THAT THEY  HAD ELECTRICITY TO DO THIS.
- THAT'S THE ACTUAL  HAUSSMANN TIME?
- MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.
HE WOULDN'T PUT  ELECTRICITY ON THE STREETS.
HE WANTED GAS ON THE STREETS,  
 'CAUSE HE THOUGHT  IT WAS MORE AESTHETIC.
BUT, HERE,  DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?
AND HERE YOU CAN  SEE THE TEXTURE OF THE STREET.
IT'S LIKE A COBBLESTONE.
- WELL, YEAH,  WE HAVE THAT...  
 - I THINK THAT ONE OF  THE REASONS THAT I'M MOTIVATED  
 TO DO RESEARCH  AND TO DO ALL THE READING  
 IS THAT IT'S VERY MUCH  A SET OF VALUES  
 THAT LEARNING IS GOOD.
BOOKS ARE GOOD.
THINGS IN BOOKS WILL HELP YOU.
WHO KNOWS WHERE IT CAME FROM?
PROBABLY IN LARGE PART  FROM MY PARENTS.
I GREW UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
I'M THE ELDEST OF FOUR CHILDREN.
MY NEXT SISTER IS ALICE  AND THEN MY BROTHER, DAN,  
 AND THEN MY YOUNGEST SISTER,  JULIET.
MY PARENTS MET DOING  THEIR MASTER'S IN HISTORY.
MY MOM AND DAD ARE NOTORIOUS  
 FOR NEVER JUST DRIVING BY  A HISTORICAL MARKER.
YOU ALWAYS PULL OVER  TO SEE WHAT IT IS.
IN THE SOUTH, AT LEAST  IN TERMS OF THE CIVIL WAR,  
 THERE'S THIS  HISTORICAL BURDEN.
YOU'RE AWARE PRETTY EARLY ON  
 THAT THERE ISN'T JUST  ONE VERSION THAT'S ACCEPTED,  
 THAT PEOPLE ARE KIND OF TUGGING  AT THIS HISTORICAL RECORD,  
 YOU KNOW, WANTING  TO MANIPULATE THE HISTORY  
 ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
THIS SHOT IS REALLY QUICK.
IT'S JUST A COUPLE SECONDS.
SO RUN OUT, PUT THE CHAIRS DOWN,  
 I'LL PUT THE BOARD ON,  
 HOP ON IT, START DOING THIS  AND KIND OF KICKING MY HEELS,  
 AND THEN I WANT BOTH OF YOU  
 TO KIND OF, LIKE,  LEAN OVER THE CHAIR.
THE DIRECTOR ROLE  IS NOT SOMETHING  
 THAT COMES SUPER NATURALLY.
I THINK THAT'S  ONE OF THE REASONS  
 I REALLY VALUE GETTING  TO WORK WITH MY FAMILY MEMBERS.
IT MAKES IT EASIER  FOR ME TO ASK FOR WHAT I WANT.
OKAY, GOOD.
NOWNOW WHEN YOU DO THAT, LIKE,  JOSTLE EACH OTHER, LIKE...  
 - YEAH, LIKE, HERE,  I WANT THE BETTER VIEW.
- [ laughs ]  - I WANT THE BETTER VIEW.
- NO, NO, I WANT TO GET IT.
- OKAY.
- [ laughs ]  
 - EXCELLENT, WE GOT IT.
YEP.
- GET BACK AND LAY BACK DOWN  SO I SHOULD SEE WHEN...  
 - THE ENTIRE CONCEPT  COMES OUT OF THE RESEARCH  
 AND OUT OF THE READING.
SEE, 'CAUSE I DON'T  HAVE A PILLOW,  
 IT'S GONNA  MAKE YOUR LIFE HARDER.
AND IT'S MY CHOICE  OF WHAT WE DO.
SO I THINK YOU'RE GONNA  HAVE TO BRING IT AROUND  
 TO THE SIDE.
AND THEN ONCE WE'RE  KIND OF ON THE WAY,  
 MY HUSBAND, PAT,  IS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC  
 TO JUST PICK UP WHATEVER  IS HAPPENING AND RUN WITH IT.
- DO WE WANT TO BE  STRAIGHT DOWN?
- UH, YEAH.
- IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT PLACE?
- ERIC WOULD IT BE CRAZY FOR ME  
 TO SHOOT  FROM THAT GAP RIGHT THERE?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE MADE THAT  BIG LEAP FROM BEING A PAINTER  
 TO SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED  AND AS TECHNICALLY INVOLVED  
 AS THIS WORK WITHOUT PAT.
- SECRETLY, SECRETLY  QUEEN MARIE ANTOINETTE  
 STUDIED HER ALGEBRA  ALL NIGHT IN BED.
SCHOLARS REMARKED  AT THE MATHEMATICIAN.
HER BEAUTY'S RESOLVED  TO MAKE KNOWLEDGE WIDESPREAD.
- THAT WAS IT, YEAH.
THAT WAS GREAT.
- OKAY.
- AWESOME.
OKAY.
- SECRETLY, SECRETLY  QUEEN MARIE ANTOINETTE  
 STUDIED HER ALGEBRA  ALL NIGHT IN BED.
SCHOLARS REMARKED  AT THE MATHEMATICIAN.
HER BEAUTY'S RESOLVED  TO MAKE KNOWLEDGE WIDESPREAD.
- AFTER WE SHOOT THIS,  AND WE'LL SHOOT THAT,  
 AND THEN WE HAVE A BREAK.
THEN YOU GUYS ARE JUST  GONNA HAVE TO HANG OUT,  
 MAYBE EAT ANOTHER PCE OF PIZZA  WHILE I GET INTO SISYPHUS,  
 AND THEN WE'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE  LARGER, WIDER SHOTS SO...  
 - WE HAVE THE BAGUETTES, RIGHT?
- OH, YES, AND THE BAGUETTES.
- I BAGUETTE YOU.
- YES, THE DANDY OUTFITS, YEAH.
SO WE'RE DOING GOOD, BUT WE  GOT A LOT MORE TO GO, SO...  
 [ sighs ]  
 SO STAY DOWN.
- I LOVE TO PUT ON MAKEUP.
THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS  OF MAKING THE WORK  
 IS GETTING DRAW THE FACE ON.
MY MOTHER NEVER WORE MAKEUP,  
 AND I WAS ALWAYS  OBSESSED WITH IT.
THE EYES BLOCK OUT EVERYTHING.
WHEN I LOOK OUT OF THE EYES,  
 I SEE VERY LITTLE,  WHICH IS GREAT.
AND IT'SIT'S HELPED ME  DO THE PERFORMANCE.
AND I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE  STARTED PERFORMING WITHOUT THEM.
ABOUT IN THE RIGHT SPOT?
- MM-HMM, LOOKS GREAT.
- OKAY.
OKAY.
- WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TITLE?
THE SYPH....  
 - OKAY, I ALWAYS...  SIS...  
 - SISYPHUS, THAT'S RIGHT?
SISYPHUS.
- I'M GUESSING PARTIALLY  
 BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY  RHYMES WITH SYPHILIS.
- SYPH...  SYPH...  
 - THE SYPHILIS OF SISYPHUS?
- NO, IS THAT RIGHT?
[ chuckles ]  
 - THE TITLE OF THE NEW FILM  IS THE SYPHILIS OF SISYPHUS.
MOST OF THE TEXT  FROM THIS FILM  
 IS JUST KIND OF THE EXTENDED  POLEMICAL MUSINGS OF THIS WOMAN,  
 THIS FEMALE CHARACTER,  SISYPHUS.
SHE'S A PROSTITUTE.
AT THE BEGINNING, WE KIND OF  SEE HER GETTING READY TO GO OUT,  
 AND SHE'S DOING HER TOILET  AND PUTTING ON HER MAKEUP.
SO NOW, REMEMBER,  WHEN SHE STARTS,  
 SHE'S, LIKE, NOT MAD.
- RIGHT.
- SHE'SSHE'S ALMOST SAD,  BUT SHE'S BITTER.
SHE'S NOT, LIKE, SWEETLY SAD.
SHE'S NOT, LIKE, RESIGNED SAD.
SHE'S BITTER SAD.
POUTING SAD.
- FACE RIGHT.
- I CAN ACTUALLY SEE  MY REFLECTION IN THE CAMERA,  
 IT'S KIND OF HELPFUL.
- YEAH.
[ indistinct speech ]  
 - THAT'S SO MAGRITTE.
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THAT  TILL JUST NOW.
- [ laughs ]  IT IS.
- IT'S, LIKE, CRAZY KAT  MEETS MAGRITTE.
NATURE SOLD ME A LIE.
AND I'VE KEPT THE DECEIT  ON MY FACE  
 TO REMIND ME HER FALSEHOODS  REPEAT LIKE THE SEASONS RENEW.
SAME ADVICE EVERY TIME  BECAUSE NATURE CAN COUNSEL ME  
 NOTHING BUT CRIME.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE  ABOUT ENCOUNTERING PAINTINGS  
 IS LOOKING AT THEM OVER TIME  
 AND COMING BACK  AND VIEWING IT AGAIN.
SO WHEN I MAKE VIDEO WORKS,  
 I LOVE THE IDEA  OF PEOPLE COMING BACK TO THEM  
 AND SEEING THEM  OVER AND OVER  
 AND ALWAYS GET SOMETHING NEW.
HER UTOPIAN SWINDLES  PROFESS TO BE CURES,  
 BUT, IN FACT, GENERATIONS  WHILE SMEARED WITH MANURE;  
 AS A YOUNG NAIVE MILKMAID  IN APRON AND BRAIDS,  
 I, TOO, WAS REVOLTING  ON TOP OF THE BARRICADES.
PRAISING THE RUSTIC,  I FELL TO GOURMET,  
 AND MY RADICAL URGES  WERE LOST DUE TO NEGLIGEE.
SHAMED BY THIS LAPSE  INTO LUXURIES ERROR,  
 I HID MY DEFECTIONS  TILL THIS HAPPY MIRROR  
 REVEALED A NEW CAUSE  FOR WHICH SISYPHUS SHOULDERS  
 THE BURDENS OF CHARM,  CRYING: MAKE BEAUTY BOULDER.
- AN ARTIST'S RELATION  TO SOLITUDE.
AN ARTIST MUST MAKE TIME  FOR THE LONG PERIOD OF SOLITUDE.
SOLITUDE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
AWAY FROM HOME,  AWAY FROM STUDIO,  
 AWAY FROM FAMILY,  AWAY FROM FRIENDS.
AN ARTIST  HAS TO UNDERSTAND SILENCE.
AN ARTIST HAS TO CREATE A SPACE  FOR SILENCE TO ENTER HIS WORK.
SILENCE IS LIKE AN ISLAND  
 IN THE MIDDLE  OF TURBULENT OCEAN.
MY PHYSICAL ENDURANCE  AND THE EXTREME WILLPOWER  
 I THINK I GOT  FROM MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER,  
 BECAUSE MY MOTHER  AND MY FATHER,  
 THEY REALLY BELIEVE  IN THE COMMUNISM,  
 AND THEY BELIEVE IN SACRIFICE  FOR THE CAUSE.
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE WAS NOTHING.
IT'S IMPORTANT  WHAT YOU ARE LIVING FOR.
IT'S JUST, LIKE, VERY, VERY  STOIC AND VERY DEDICATED.
THAT'S HOW I WAS EDUCATED.
MY MOTHER, WHEN HER WATER BROKE  WHEN SHE WAS GIVING BIRTH TO ME,  
 SHE WAS HAVING  COMMUNIST PARTY MEETING,  
 AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO STOP  BEFORE SHE FINISHED IT.
AND THEN SHE  WENT TO THE HOSPITAL  
 AND GIVE THE BIRTH TO ME.
I WAS THINKING THIS IS NORMAL.
I WAS THINKING THIS IS  HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT EVERYTHING  ELSE CAN BE DIFFERENT.
COMING FROM FORMER YUGOSLAVIA,  
 FROM THE REALLY INTERESTING  FAMILY BACKGROUND,  
 WHICH MOTHER AND FATHER DON'T  BELIEVE IN ANY KIND OF RELIGION  
 AND BEING TAKEN CARE OF  BY MY GRANDMOTHER,  
 WHO WAS COMPLETELY  RELIGIOUS FANATIC,  
 HAVING, YOU KNOW, GRANDFATHER  
 WHO WAS A SAINT  OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH,  
 THAT WAS A KIND OF  ALMOST UNBEATABLE COMBINATION  
 TO GROW AS AN ARTIST.
FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS.
PERFORMANCE IS A TOOL  HOW I CAN EXPRESS MYSELF.
AND I THINK,  IN THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST,  
 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT  TO FIND THE RIGHT TOOL.
AND I HAVE TO SAY  THAT I WAS VERY LUCKY  
 THAT IT CAME SO EARLY TO ME,  SO CLEARLY.
SINCE I REMEMBER,  I WAS ALWAYS DRAWING EVERYWHERE.
I START ON THE LITTLE,  YOU KNOW, PAPERS  
 AND THEN I WENT TO THE WALLS  
 AND THEN THE PARENTS  REALLY UNDERSTOOD  
 THAT THEY SHOULD  GIVE ME MORE PAPERS  
 AND THEN I STARTED  DOING THE CANVASES  
 AND THEN IN NO TIME,  I WAS PAINTING.
AND WITH AGE 12,  I HAD MY FIRST EXHIBITION.
I REMEMBER THAT MY FIRST PERIOD  WHICH I WAS PAINTING,  
 IT WAS SOMETHING GIVEN TO ME  ALREADY; IT WAS MY DREAMS.
I HAD VERY, VERY VIVID DREAMS.
SOMETIMES THE DREAM  WAS MORE THAN REALITY,  
 AND I WILL WAKE UP, AND REALITY  WILL LOOK LIKE THE DREAM,  
 AND DREAM  LOOK LIKE REAL THING.
SO THE DREAMS WAS  ALWAYS BEING PAINTED  
 IN A KIND OF BLUE AND GREEN.
JUST THESE TWO COLORS I HAD.
AND LATER ON, I REMEMBER  BEING VERY INTERESTED  
 IN TRUCK ACCIDENTS.
I WAS CRAZY ABOUT  COMMUNIST BIG GREEN TRUCKS  
 AND HOW THEY'RE COLLIDING.
SO I WOULD GO TO THE ACTUALLY  SCENES OF ACCIDENTS TOOK PLACE,  
 TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS,  GO BACK, AND PAINT THEM.
AND THEN I WAS THINKING,  
 "OKAY, BUT WHAT IF THE BIG TRUCK  WILL BE HIT BY THE LITTLE CAR,  
 LIKE A CHILDREN CAR?"
SO I WILL GO AND BUY LITTLE TOYS  
 AND I WOULD PUT THEM  ON THE HIGHWAYS  
 AND I WAITED THE BIG TRUCK,  YOU KNOW, SMASH THEM.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
THIS LITTLE TOYS  WAS ALWAYS BEING UNTOUCHED  
 BY THE BIG TRUCKS.
SO I STARTED GOING HOME  AND PAINTING THESE BIG TRUCKS  
 BEING SMASHED BY THESE  WONDERFUL LITTLE INNOCENT  
 CHILDREN TRUCKS.
AND THEN AFTER TRUCKS,  I GET TO NEW PERIOD ALTOGETHER,  
 AND I START PAINT THE SKY.
AND I WAS CRAZY ABOUT CLOUDS.
THE CLOUDS WERE COMING,  THE SHADOWS AND THE CLOUDS,  
 AND IT KIND OF BECOME  A KIND OF MYSTICAL CHEMICAL  
 KIND OF A DIMENSION.
AND I REMEMBER  SO WELL THAT MOMENT,  
 AND I THINK I WAS IN MY  BEGINNING OF MY 20s,  
 LYING ON THE GRASS FLD  AND LOOKING TO THE SKY.
JUST PLAIN BLUE SKY.
AND IN THIS PLAIN BLUE SKY,  
 I SAW THE 12  ULTRASONIC AIRPLANES PASSING BY  
 AND LEAVING  THIS COMPLETE SHARP LINE.
I SEE IN THE FRONT OF MY EYES,  FIRST, BLUE SKY,  
 THEN THE LINES CREATED  BY ULTRASONIC PLANES  
 DISSOLVE IN THE AIR  INTO BLUE SKY AGAIN.
AND I THINK IT WAS, FOR ME,  LIKE A SPIRITUAL REVELATION.
I REMEMBER STAND UP  AND I WANT IMMEDIATELY  
 TO GO TO THE MILITARY  HEADQUARTERS  
 AND ASK GENERAL THERE  IF THEY CAN BORROW ME  
 12 ULTRASONIC PLANES  TO MAKE THE DRAWINGS IN THE SKY.
MY FATHER WAS THE GENERAL.
BECAUSE THEY KNOW MY FATHER,  THEY IMMEDIATELY CALLED HIM  
 AND SAY, "YOUR DAUGHTER'S  COMPLETELY CRAZY.
"GET HER OUT OF HERE.
"DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS  TO FLY THE ULTRASONIC PLANES  
 FOR HER TO MAKE DRAWINGS  IN THE SKY?"
SO VERY EARLY,  UNDERSTOOD THAT  
 THERE IS CERTAIN THINGS  I CAN'T DO.
BUT IN THE SAME TIME,  I GOT A REVELATION  
 IN THIS MOMENT  OF LOOKING TO BLUE SKY  
 THAT ACTUALLY I CAN USE  EVERYTHING I WANT.
I CAN USE THE WATER,  THE ISLANDS,  
 THE FIRE, THE EARTH,  THE AIR, AND MYSELF.
AND THIS WAS THE MOMENT  THAT I DECIDED  
 THAT IT'S COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS  TO GO TO THE STUDIO  
 AND MAKE SOMETHING  THAT IS TWO-DIMENSIONAL  
 WHEN I COULD HAVE ENTIRE WORLD  THERE FOR ME.
AND THAT'S WHEN  I STOPPED PAINTING.
SO AFTER THIS HUGE REVELATION,  
 ACTUALLY WHAT FOR ME  WAS VERY INTERESTING  
 IS TO START WORKING  WITH THE SOUND.
WHAT WAS INTERESTING ME  ABOUT THE SOUND  
 IS TO CREATE SOUND ENVIRONMENTS  WHERE, YOU KNOW,  
 YOU HAVE ONE IMPRESSION  LISTENING TO THE SOUND  
 BUT VISUALLY,  COMPLETELY ANOTHER IMPRESSION.
SO THE FIRST IDEA I HAD,  IT WAS TO PUT THE SPEAKERS  
 ON THE BRIDGE,  OF THE MAIN BRIDGE IN BELGRADE,  
 WITH THE SOUND  OF BRIDGE COLLAPSING.
SO WHEN YOU'RE  ON THE BRIDGE ITSELF,  
 WITH EVERY THREE MINUTES,  THE BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN  
 BUT, VISUALLY, IT'S NOT.
AND OF COURSE TO DO SUCH ACTION,  YOU NEED TO GET PERMISSION  
 FROM THE CITY MAYOR.
SO I WENT  TO THE CITY MAYOR HOUSE.
AGAIN, HAPPENED THE SAME THING,  
 THEY ABSOLUTELY  FORBID TO DO THIS,  
 BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME THAT,  ACTUALLY, FROM THE VIBRATIONS  
 WITH THAT KIND OF SOUND,  THE BRIDGE CAN REALLY FALL DOWN.
SO I COULD NOT DO IT.
THEN I DID IT WITH THE BUILDING  WHERE I WAS LIVING,  
 BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR TEN MINUTES  THE WHOLE PCE,  
 BECAUSE THE PEOPLE, INHABITANTS,  WERE JUST RUNNING OUT  
 THINKING THAT  EVERYTHING'S BOMBED.
SO THAT WAS KIND OF BIG MESS.
SOMEHOW DEALING WITH THE SOUND,  I COME TO THE POINT  
 WHEN I HAD MY FIRST PERFORMANCE    RHYTHM 10,  
 WHICH ACTUALLY USED THE KNIVES.
AND THE RHYTHM 10  IS A SOUND PCE, AGAIN.
I HAVE THE, YOU KNOW,  TAPE RECORDERS  
 AND I WAS DOING  CERTAIN GAME TWICE.
WHEN IT WAS MY BODY INVOLVED.
AND THE MOMENT WHEN I INVOLVED  MY BODY IN THE PERFORMANCE,  
 THIS INCREDIBLE ENERGY DIALOGUE  WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE PUBLIC.
IT WAS SO OVERWHELMING  
 THAT I COULD NOT EVER COME BACK  TO ANY OTHER FORM OF ART.
IN THE BEGINNING, IN MY EARLY  WORK WITH PERFORMANCE,  
 I REALLY EMBRACED  REPETITION.
IT WAS TO REPEAT CERTAIN ACTION  OVER AND OVER AGAIN  
 TO COME TO THE KIND OF ALMOST  CHARISMATIC STATE OF MIND.
AND THE PERFORMANCES  IN THE BEGINNING,  
 QUITE VIOLENT  AND VERY TOUGH.
YOU KNOW,  LIKE RUN INTO THE WALL  
 OR BREAKING THE WALLS,  
 CUTTING THE STARS  IN THE STOMACH,  
 LYING ON THE ICE,  BEATING YOURSELF  
 TO SEE HOW FAR,  PHYSICALLY, YOU CAN GO  
 AND TRANSCENDENT, ACTUALLY,  THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE  
 INTO SOMETHING ELSE.
LATER ON, THE MORE AND MORE  PERFORMANCE I DEVELOP,  
 I BECOME MORE AND MORE  INTERESTED  
 IN MENTAL STATE OF PCE  
 AND THEN EXTEND THE TIME.
THE LONGER PERFORMANCE GETS,  
 THE MORE TRANSCENDENTAL CAN GET  
 AND TRANSFORMATIVE  TO THE PERFORMER DOING IT,  
 BUT ALSO TO  PUBLIC PARTICIPATING.
SO THIS IS THE  ACTUALLY, THE DOOR  
 OF SOMETHING COMPLETELY ELSE.
HOW YOU CAN  ELEVATE HUMAN SPIRIT.
AS YOU SEE AROUND US, OUR LIFE  IS SO SHORT AND SO FAST.
MINE, I HAVE NO TIME  FOR ANYTHING.
SO THE LONGER I DO PERFORMANCE,  THE BETTER THINGS GET.
I THINK THAT ART  SHOULD GO LONGER AND LONGER  
 AS LIFE BECOMES  SHORTER AND SHORTER.
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU CAN'T TAKE  YOUR PHYSICAL GOODS WITH YOU,  
 BUT A GOOD IDEA CAN STAY.
I AM VERY OCCUPIED NOW  ABOUT MY LEGACY.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME,  PRESERVATION PERFORMANCE ART  
 AND HOW THEY'RE  GOING TO DEVELOP  
 AND WHAT IS THE FUTURE  OF PERFORMANCE ART.
THREE YEARS AGO,  FOR MY OWN BIRTHDAY,  
 I PURCHASED A BUILDING  IN HUDSON.
IT'S A VERY LARGE SPACE.
WE CAN HOST ABOUT 1,500 PEOPLE.
I WAS INTERESTING  TO CREATE SITUATION  
 WHICH WILL BE REALLY CENTER  FOR PRESERVATION  
 FOR PERFORMANCE ART,  
 BUT ALSO TO COMMISSION  THE YOUNG ARTISTS  
 AND VERY KNOWN ARTISTS  TO MAKE LONG DURATION  
 OF PERFORMANCE WORK.
BUT NOT JUST  PERFORMANCE I'M DOING,  
 BUT ALSO THE THEATER,  THE MUSIC, THE VIDEO,  
 THE DANCE, THE OPERA.
JUST LONG DURATION.
I'M DEVELOPING SYSTEM  THAT YOU NEVER LEAVE THE SPACE.
I WANTED TO CREATE  SOME KIND OF SITUATION  
 WHERE YOU HAVE THE SEATS,  
 AFTER MAYBE THREE HOURS  YOU'RE REALLY TIRED,  
 THE SEAT RECLINING  TO LITTLE BED.
YOU HAVE A LITTLE BLANKET.
YOU COVER YOURSELF.
YOU GO TO SLEEP.
YOU WAKE UP, PCE IS GOING ON.
ON THE LEFT SIDE  IS A COLD DRINK  
 INSIDE THE CHAIR ARM.
AND THE OTHER SIDE IS HOT MEAL.
A LITTLE LAMP IF YOU  WANT TO WRITE THE NOTES.
SO THAT YOU'RE REALLY INSIDE THE  PCE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
I'VE REALLY  BEEN THINKING SO MUCH,  
 YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE ROLE  OF AN ARTIST?
WHAT IS MY FUNCTION  ON THIS EARTH ANYWAY?
I THINK THAT BEING AN ARTIST  IS SUCH A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.
IN MY CASE, I CREATE  THREE GROUPS OF THE ATTITUDES,  
 WHAT I HAVE TO DO AS AN ARTIST.
I CALLED THE FIRST GROUP  IS ARTIST'S BODY.
AND JUST VERY SIMPLE;  IS ME PERFORMING  
 IN THE FRONT OF AUDIENCE.
SECOND IS THE PUBLIC BODY,  IS TO CREATE OBJECTS  
 I CALL THEM TRANSITORY  BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SCULPTURES  
 AND CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH  THE PUBLIC CAN ACTUALLY  
 PERFORM FOR THEMSELVES  AND GET EXPERIENCE.
AND THE THIRD,  IT WILL BE STUDENT BODY.
AND THIS IS MY FUNCTION  AS A TEACHER,  
 THAT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU COME  TO ONE POINT OF YOUR LIFE,  
 THAT YOU REALLY  HAVE TO UNCONDITIONALLY  
 TRANSFER THE KNOWLEDGE  
 TO YOUNGER GENERATION  OF ARTIST.
AND NOT ONLY TRANSFER IT  
 BUT ALSO HELP THEM  IN THE DEVELOPMENT.
IT'S A REALLY, IN A WAY,  SOME KIND OF FAIR DIALOGUE,  
 BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU  SENSE OF TIME YOU LIVE IN  
 BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUNG  
 AND THEY UNDERSTAND DIFFERENTLY  THE WORLD,  
 AND YOU GIVE THEM  THE EXPERIENCE.
YOU CAN'T DECIDE  WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DIE,  
 BUT YOU DEFINITELY  CAN REHEARSE YOUR FUNERAL.
WITH A LAWYER,  I ACTUALLY MADE MY TESTAMENT  
 WHICH MY REAL WISH ABOUT MY  FUNERAL IS TO BE THREE COFFINS,  
 ONE WITH REAL MARINA  AND TWO FAKE MARINAS.
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE BURIED  
 IN THREE DIFFERENT PLACES  IN THE WORLD,  
 WHICH I LIVED THE LONGEST.
MEANS BELGRADE,  IN EX-YUGOSLAVIA, NOW SERBIA;  
 AMSTERDAM, IN HOLLAND;  
 AND NEW YORK,  WHICH I LIVE RIGHT NOW.
THEY WILL BE  SIMULTANEOUS BURYING.
IN ALL OF THESE FUNERALS,  PEOPLE WILL NOT WEAR ANY BLACK  
 BUT REALLY BRIGHT CLOTHES,  LIKE GREEN OR RED AND PINK  
 AND ACID Ã©LOW AND SO ON.
AND IT WILL BE  VERY FESTIVE SITUATION.
AND REALLY, IDEA:  YOU KNOW, YOU LIVE WELL;  
 YOU HAVE TO DIE WELL TOO.
AN ARTIST SHOULD  LOOK DEEP INSIDE THEMSELVES  
 FOR INSPIRATION.
THE DEEPER THEY LOOK  INSIDE THEMSELVES,  
 THE MORE UNIVERSAL  THEY BECOME.
THE ARTIST IS UNIVERSE.
THE ARTIST IS UNIVERSE.
THE ARTIST IS UNIVERSE.
announcer: NEXT TIME  ON ART IN THE 21ST CENTURY...  
 - I GET VERY POSSESSIVE  OF MY PLACES,  
 AND I DON'T WANT  ANY OTHER ARTIST  
 COMING AROUND HERE AND PAINTING.
- I REALLY LIKE THIS IDEA  THAT NATURAL WILDLIFE  
 SURVIVES IN THIS  INTENSE METROPOLIS.
- MY INFLUENCE COMES  FROM THE HISTORY OF ART  
 AND THE CULTURE OF OUR TIMES.
