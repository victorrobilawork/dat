WELL, ONE THING THAT REALLY
 WELL, ONE THING THAT REALLY INTERESTS ME IS--AND IT COMES
 INTERESTS ME IS--AND IT COMES OUT OF CHINESE AND JAPANESE
 OUT OF CHINESE AND JAPANESE PAINTING--IS WHERE YOU HAVE
 PAINTING--IS WHERE YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF
 A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPACE IN THE SAME PAINTING.
SPACE IN THE SAME PAINTING.
YOU HAVE A KIND OF DEEP SPACE,
 YOU HAVE A KIND OF DEEP SPACE, AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE
 AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE RIGHT UP ON THE SURFACE.
RIGHT UP ON THE SURFACE.
THIS PAINTING THAT WE WERE
 THIS PAINTING THAT WE WERE PAINTING ON TODAY HAS THAT.
PAINTING ON TODAY HAS THAT.
IT HAS THE CONVERGING LINES
 IT HAS THE CONVERGING LINES GOING OFF INTO SPACE AND THEN
 GOING OFF INTO SPACE AND THEN THE DRIP COMING DOWN THE FACE OF
 THE DRIP COMING DOWN THE FACE OF THE PAINTING, WHICH IS, LIKE,
 THE PAINTING, WHICH IS, LIKE, FLAT.
FLAT.
NOW THE FAKE DRIP.
NOW THE FAKE DRIP.
SO THAT THERE ARE TWO REALITIES
 SO THAT THERE ARE TWO REALITIES GOING ON IN THE SAME PAINTING.
ANOTHER THING THAT SPEAKS TO
 ANOTHER THING THAT SPEAKS TO THAT IS THESE PAINTINGS THAT ARE
 THAT IS THESE PAINTINGS THAT ARE ON THIS DOUBLE SQUARE SHAPED
 ON THIS DOUBLE SQUARE SHAPED CANVAS, AND OFTEN I PUT A DEEP
 CANVAS, AND OFTEN I PUT A DEEP SPACE KIND OF MOTIF ON A SHAPED
 SPACE KIND OF MOTIF ON A SHAPED CANVAS LIKE THAT, AND THEN THE
 CANVAS LIKE THAT, AND THEN THE TWO SQUARES THAT ARE THE EMPTY
 TWO SQUARES THAT ARE THE EMPTY SPACE MAKE THE WALL BE PART OF
 SPACE MAKE THE WALL BE PART OF THE PAINTING.
THE PAINTING.
OF COURSE, THEN YOU GET REAL
 OF COURSE, THEN YOU GET REAL SPACE AND THEN THE FAKE SPACE
 SPACE AND THEN THE FAKE SPACE AND THEN ALSO THE PHYSICAL
 AND THEN ALSO THE PHYSICAL OBJECT THAT'S THE CANVAS.
OBJECT THAT'S THE CANVAS.
SO THERE YOU'VE GOT THREE KINDS
 SO THERE YOU'VE GOT THREE KINDS OF SPACE IN THE SAME PAINTING.
OF SPACE IN THE SAME PAINTING.
THE SHAPED CANVAS COMES OUT OF
 THE SHAPED CANVAS COMES OUT OF MY OWN THINKING ABOUT GEOMETRY.
MY OWN THINKING ABOUT GEOMETRY.
LIKE, A LOT OF MY FIGURING OUT

I'VE PROBABLY BEEN THINKING
 I'VE PROBABLY BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR FOUR MONTHS, TRYING
 ABOUT IT FOR FOUR MONTHS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THAT

 THESE SIMPLE IDEAS BECOME OBSESSIONS, ALMOST LIKE
 OBSESSIONS, ALMOST LIKE A MEDITATION.
A MEDITATION.
SIT DOWN HERE AND THINK ABOUT

HOW FABULOUS THAT IS.
MAYBE HAVE TO DO A FEW LITTLE
 MAYBE HAVE TO DO A FEW LITTLE TOUCH-UPS ON IT, BUT THAT'S
 TOUCH-UPS ON IT, BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
I TAKE PICTURES AND THEY'RE JUST

IN THE BACK OF MY MIND.
I DON'T REALLY LOOK AT 'EM WHEN
 I DON'T REALLY LOOK AT 'EM WHEN I'M PAINTING.
I'M PAINTING.
NOW, LATELY I'VE BEEN MAKING
 NOW, LATELY I'VE BEEN MAKING SOME DIGITAL PRINTS, WHICH
 SOME DIGITAL PRINTS, WHICH I COMBINE WITH ETCHING.
I COMBINE WITH ETCHING.
AND YOU GET THE IDEA OF THE TWO
 AND YOU GET THE IDEA OF THE TWO KINDS OF WAY OF MAKING IMAGES.
KINDS OF WAY OF MAKING IMAGES.
AND I ALWAYS HAVE USED
 AND I ALWAYS HAVE USED A SLIDESHOW WHEN I GIVE ARTIST
 A SLIDESHOW WHEN I GIVE ARTIST TALKS.
TALKS.
THE SLIDESHOW INVOLVES USING
 THE SLIDESHOW INVOLVES USING A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGERY
 A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGERY WITH THE PAINTING IMAGES.
I'M A VERY HOLY LITTLE CATHOLIC

STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN.
CRAZY AS THE MARTYRDOM FANTASY
 CRAZY AS THE MARTYRDOM FANTASY IS, IT JUST MADE SUCH A FABULOUS
 IS, IT JUST MADE SUCH A FABULOUS STORY, AND THE WAY YOU FLEW UP
 STORY, AND THE WAY YOU FLEW UP TO HEAVEN WAS SO FABULOUS.

GROWING UP WITH THOSE KINDS OF
 GROWING UP WITH THOSE KINDS OF STORIES HAS CARRIED ON INTO MY
 STORIES HAS CARRIED ON INTO MY LIFE, THE WAY I THINK AND MAKE

 ART FEELS LIKE AN ICON IN THE WAY ICONS WERE WHEN I WAS LITTLE
 WAY ICONS WERE WHEN I WAS LITTLE IS REALLY A TRUE THING.
IS REALLY A TRUE THING.

IT'S NOT SO SPECIFIC.
MY SPIRITUAL LIFE IS VERY

IT'S FINISHED.
I GUESS MOSTLY THE STORIES AND
 I GUESS MOSTLY THE STORIES AND THE IMAGES IS PROBABLY THE MAIN
 THE IMAGES IS PROBABLY THE MAIN WAY THAT THIS KIND OF THINKING
 WAY THAT THIS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT WORK RELATES TO
 ABOUT WORK RELATES TO MY CHILDHOOD.

I'M TRYING TO RECAPTURE A VIEW
 I'M TRYING TO RECAPTURE A VIEW OF AN OLD POSTCARD OF THE CITY
 OF AN OLD POSTCARD OF THE CITY OF STRALSUND.
OF STRALSUND.
I TRY TO FIND IMAGES THAT I FIND
 I TRY TO FIND IMAGES THAT I FIND INTERESTING, AND THEN I WORK MY
 INTERESTING, AND THEN I WORK MY WAY UP FROM THOSE IMAGES.
WAY UP FROM THOSE IMAGES.
THE ACTUAL IMAGE THAT I GET
 THE ACTUAL IMAGE THAT I GET FROM THE LAB THE NEXT DAY,
 FROM THE LAB THE NEXT DAY, THAT'S ONLY HALF OF THE PROCESS.
THAT'S ONLY HALF OF THE PROCESS.
I WORK ON THE IMAGES A LOT
 I WORK ON THE IMAGES A LOT AFTERWARDS.
AFTERWARDS.
I DRAW IN THEM.
I DRAW IN THEM.
I ENHANCE THEM, AND I CONSTRUCT
 I ENHANCE THEM, AND I CONSTRUCT THEM TO A DEGREE THAT'S NOT
 THEM TO A DEGREE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY LINKED TO ACTUALITY
 NECESSARILY LINKED TO ACTUALITY ANYMORE.
ANYMORE.
IT'S MORE LIKE AN IDEALIZED
 IT'S MORE LIKE AN IDEALIZED IMAGE, LIKE MAYBE THE WAY

POSTCARDS USED TO WORK.
SOMETIMES I WORK ON THE IMAGES
 SOMETIMES I WORK ON THE IMAGES JUST A WEEK.
JUST A WEEK.
SOMETIMES IT TAKES MONTHS.
I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S GONNA WORK
 I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S GONNA WORK OUT TODAY, BUT THE VIEW IS GOOD.
OUT TODAY, BUT THE VIEW IS GOOD.
THERE'S NO FOG, AND IT'S ALMOST
 THERE'S NO FOG, AND IT'S ALMOST AS I EXPECTED IT.
THAT'S THE REFERENCE.
THAT'S THE REFERENCE.
IT'S AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH OF
 IT'S AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH OF STRALSUND BACK IN GDR TIMES,
 STRALSUND BACK IN GDR TIMES, CIRCA 1970.
CIRCA 1970.
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S VERY
 I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S VERY SPARSELY LIT.
SPARSELY LIT.
IT'S VERY MINIMAL.
IT'S VERY MINIMAL.
YOU STILL HAVE THOSE GOTHIC
 YOU STILL HAVE THOSE GOTHIC CATHEDRALS IN THE BACKGROUND,
 CATHEDRALS IN THE BACKGROUND, BUT THEN IN THE FRONT YOU HAVE
 BUT THEN IN THE FRONT YOU HAVE FUNCTIONAL BUILDINGS, BASIC
 FUNCTIONAL BUILDINGS, BASIC SHAPES.
SHAPES.
AND THEN IT'S VERY BASIC.
AND THEN IT'S VERY BASIC.
IMAGE CUTS IN HALF.
IMAGE CUTS IN HALF.
YOU HAVE SKY, AND THEN YOU HAVE
 YOU HAVE SKY, AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS FOREGROUND.
THIS FOREGROUND.
I LIKE THE WAY IT BECOMES
 I LIKE THE WAY IT BECOMES VERY ABSTRACT.
VERY ABSTRACT.
FINAL IMAGE MIGHT LOOK MUCH
 FINAL IMAGE MIGHT LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THIS, BUT I KIND
 DIFFERENT FROM THIS, BUT I KIND OF LIKE THE BASIC COMPOSITION
 OF LIKE THE BASIC COMPOSITION OF IT.
OF IT.
THERE'S MAYBE, LIKE, 15 LIGHT
 THERE'S MAYBE, LIKE, 15 LIGHT SOURCES, AND TODAY, IT'S NOT THE
 SOURCES, AND TODAY, IT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.
CASE ANYMORE.
IT'S ACTUALLY OVERLIT BECAUSE
 IT'S ACTUALLY OVERLIT BECAUSE IT'S UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE AND
 IT'S UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE AND YOU CAN ALREADY SEE THAT ALL THE
 YOU CAN ALREADY SEE THAT ALL THE SPOTS ARE ON THE DOMES.
SPOTS ARE ON THE DOMES.
SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES HAVE BEEN
 SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES HAVE BEEN TORN DOWN, AND THEY ALSO
 TORN DOWN, AND THEY ALSO CONSTRUCTED THIS NEW GEHRY TYPE
 CONSTRUCTED THIS NEW GEHRY TYPE AQUARIUM OVER THERE, THAT WHITE
 AQUARIUM OVER THERE, THAT WHITE SPOT.
SPOT.
SO I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT
 SO I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT OUT BECAUSE THAT'S TOO MODERN,
 OUT BECAUSE THAT'S TOO MODERN, TOO WHITE.
I SAW THIS PLACE BY ACCIDENT,
 I SAW THIS PLACE BY ACCIDENT, BECAUSE IT'S A MURAL IN
 BECAUSE IT'S A MURAL IN A STATION OF STRALSUND IN EAST
 A STATION OF STRALSUND IN EAST GERMANY.
GERMANY.
IT HAD A VERY NOSTALGIC GERMAN
 IT HAD A VERY NOSTALGIC GERMAN FEELING ABOUT AN OLD-TIME
 FEELING ABOUT AN OLD-TIME ILLUSTRATION OF RUEGEN.
ILLUSTRATION OF RUEGEN.
IT IS A VERY IMPRECISE IMAGE
 IT IS A VERY IMPRECISE IMAGE OPEN TO YOUR IMAGINATION.
OPEN TO YOUR IMAGINATION.
IT DOESN'T GIVE AWAY ALL THE
 IT DOESN'T GIVE AWAY ALL THE FACTS.
FACTS.
MAPS JUST GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF
 MAPS JUST GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF A PLACE.
A PLACE.
THEY'RE LIKE AN ILLUSTRATION,
 THEY'RE LIKE AN ILLUSTRATION, BUT THEY'RE CLEARLY THE OPPOSITE
 BUT THEY'RE CLEARLY THE OPPOSITE OF A PRECISE PHOTOGRAPH.
THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE
 THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MURAL IN STRALSUND.
MURAL IN STRALSUND.
I TOOK OUT THE NAMES AND
 I TOOK OUT THE NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS AND TURNED IT INTO
 DESCRIPTIONS AND TURNED IT INTO AN EVEN MORE NONDESCRIPT IMAGE.
IT WAS PAINTED IN '36, BUT TO
 IT WAS PAINTED IN '36, BUT TO ME, IT STANDS MORE FOR THE EAST
 ME, IT STANDS MORE FOR THE EAST GERMAN SOCIAL REALIST ERA AND
 GERMAN SOCIAL REALIST ERA AND THE GLORIFICATION OF THE FARMER
 THE GLORIFICATION OF THE FARMER STATE.
STATE.
I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE REAL
 I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE REAL ISLAND WHEN I WAS THERE, AND IT
 ISLAND WHEN I WAS THERE, AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT TO ME.
DIDN'T WORK OUT TO ME.
IT WAS TOO FLAT, AND WE COULDN'T
 IT WAS TOO FLAT, AND WE COULDN'T GET HIGH UP ENOUGH, AND,
 GET HIGH UP ENOUGH, AND, OF COURSE, IT LOOKS VERY
 OF COURSE, IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE ILLUSTRATION,
 DIFFERENT TO THE ILLUSTRATION, AND SO I THOUGHT THE
 AND SO I THOUGHT THE ILLUSTRATION IS JUST ANOTHER
 ILLUSTRATION IS JUST ANOTHER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTING IT.
LEVEL OF ABSTRACTING IT.
IT LIFTS YOU TO ANOTHER LAYER
 IT LIFTS YOU TO ANOTHER LAYER THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY LINKED
 THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY LINKED TO REALISM, AND IT OPENS UP YOUR
 TO REALISM, AND IT OPENS UP YOUR OWN WORLD OR YOUR OWN
 OWN WORLD OR YOUR OWN MYTHMAKING.
IT WORKS FINE WITH AN ABSTRACT
 IT WORKS FINE WITH AN ABSTRACT IMAGE LIKE JUNE LAKE,
 IMAGE LIKE JUNE LAKE, FOR EXAMPLE.
FOR EXAMPLE.
AND
 AND IT SHOWS A SKI RESORT IN THE
 IT SHOWS A SKI RESORT IN THE SIERRAS.
SIERRAS.
WE WERE SKIING, AND I SAW THIS
 WE WERE SKIING, AND I SAW THIS IMAGE AT THE DINER, AND I WAS
 IMAGE AT THE DINER, AND I WAS INSTANTLY STRUCK BY IT FOR ITS
 INSTANTLY STRUCK BY IT FOR ITS ABSTRACT QUALITIES, BECAUSE IT
 ABSTRACT QUALITIES, BECAUSE IT COULD BE AN ABSTRACT SCRIBBLE,
 COULD BE AN ABSTRACT SCRIBBLE, BUT IT COULD ALSO BE A PIECE OF
 BUT IT COULD ALSO BE A PIECE OF LAND ART, MUCH MORE CHAOTIC THAN
 LAND ART, MUCH MORE CHAOTIC THAN JUST A PURE LINE.
JUST A PURE LINE.
MOST OF THE SKI RESORTS, AT
 MOST OF THE SKI RESORTS, AT LEAST IN THE SIERRAS, ARE BELOW
 LEAST IN THE SIERRAS, ARE BELOW TREE LINE, SO THEY HAVE TO CUT
 TREE LINE, SO THEY HAVE TO CUT OUT THE SLOPES AND BASICALLY
 OUT THE SLOPES AND BASICALLY CREATE THIS SCRIBBLE.
CREATE THIS SCRIBBLE.
AND THIS WAS ALSO ONE OF THE
 AND THIS WAS ALSO ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT I COULDN'T TAKE
 PHOTOGRAPHS THAT I COULDN'T TAKE MYSELF, BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY AN
 MYSELF, BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH.
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH.
STILL, THOUGH, A VERY ABSTRACT--
 STILL, THOUGH, A VERY ABSTRACT-- AND IT'S VERY PRECISE LIKE
 AND IT'S VERY PRECISE LIKE A SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH.
A SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH.
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE
 ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE RUEGEN, WHICH IS REALLY JUST
 RUEGEN, WHICH IS REALLY JUST LIKE VERY FEW BRUSHSTROKES AND
 LIKE VERY FEW BRUSHSTROKES AND VERY SIMPLE.
VERY SIMPLE.
JUST GIVES YOU AN ILLUSION OR AN
 JUST GIVES YOU AN ILLUSION OR AN IDEA OF HOW IT COULD LOOK.
IDEA OF HOW IT COULD LOOK.
SO IT'S VERY IMPRECISE.
SO IT'S VERY IMPRECISE.
THIS IS A PASS IN ITALY NEXT TO
 THIS IS A PASS IN ITALY NEXT TO THE SWISS BORDER.
THE SWISS BORDER.
I'VE BEEN TO THAT PASS MANY
 I'VE BEEN TO THAT PASS MANY TIMES AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
 TIMES AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, AT ONE POINT, I SAW POSTCARDS OF
 AT ONE POINT, I SAW POSTCARDS OF THAT PASS, AND I WAS JUST STRUCK
 THAT PASS, AND I WAS JUST STRUCK BY THE SCRIBBLE OF THE
 BY THE SCRIBBLE OF THE SERPENTINES.
SERPENTINES.
IT'S REALLY JUST LIKE
 IT'S REALLY JUST LIKE AN ABSTRACT GESTURE.
AN ABSTRACT GESTURE.
THE ITALIAN ENGINEERS MADE
 THE ITALIAN ENGINEERS MADE A SCRIBBLE FOR ME IN THE IMAGE.
A SCRIBBLE FOR ME IN THE IMAGE.
I BOUGHT ALL THE POSTCARDS THEY
 I BOUGHT ALL THE POSTCARDS THEY HAD TO DETERMINE IF A VANTAGE
 HAD TO DETERMINE IF A VANTAGE POINT IS VALID ENOUGH.
POINT IS VALID ENOUGH.
THE MORE IMAGES THAT ARE TAKEN
 THE MORE IMAGES THAT ARE TAKEN FROM ONE SPOT, THE MORE REASON
 FROM ONE SPOT, THE MORE REASON FOR ME TO TAKE ANOTHER
 FOR ME TO TAKE ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH, IN A WAY.
PHOTOGRAPH, IN A WAY.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE POSTCARDS.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE POSTCARDS.
YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE
 YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE THE SERPENTINES.
THE SERPENTINES.
THIS ONE, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO
 THIS ONE, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHERE I WAS.
WHERE I WAS.
THAT'S A VERY VINTAGE ONE.
THAT'S A VERY VINTAGE ONE.
THEY WOULD ALSO, JUST TO MAKE IT
 THEY WOULD ALSO, JUST TO MAKE IT MORE DRAMATIC, PAINT IN WHITE
 MORE DRAMATIC, PAINT IN WHITE SNOW, WHICH I ALSO DID ON THIS
 SNOW, WHICH I ALSO DID ON THIS ONE, BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH
 ONE, BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH SNOW, AND I WANT TO HAVE THOSE
 SNOW, AND I WANT TO HAVE THOSE FIELDS OF WHITE SNOW.
FIELDS OF WHITE SNOW.
SO I JUST DREW THEM IN MYSELF.
SO I JUST DREW THEM IN MYSELF.
AS A REFERENCE TO THE POSTCARDS,
 AS A REFERENCE TO THE POSTCARDS, I THOUGHT, "I'LL TRY TO USE
 I THOUGHT, "I'LL TRY TO USE A PROCESS THAT IS MAYBE LINKED
 A PROCESS THAT IS MAYBE LINKED TO, LIKE, OFFSET PRINTING AND--
 TO, LIKE, OFFSET PRINTING AND-- AND EVEN OLD COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY."
AND EVEN OLD COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY."
IT'S CALLED TRICOLOR
 IT'S CALLED TRICOLOR PHOTOGRAPHY.
PHOTOGRAPHY.
TAKE THREE BLACK AND WHITE
 TAKE THREE BLACK AND WHITE EXPOSURES WITH THREE DIFFERENT
 EXPOSURES WITH THREE DIFFERENT FILTERS: RED, BLUE, AND GREEN.
FILTERS: RED, BLUE, AND GREEN.
AND THEN YOU SANDWICH THOSE
 AND THEN YOU SANDWICH THOSE THREE NEGATIVES TOGETHER.
THREE NEGATIVES TOGETHER.
THE END RESULT IS A COLOR
 THE END RESULT IS A COLOR PHOTOGRAPH.
PHOTOGRAPH.
BUT SINCE YOU'RE SANDWICHING
 BUT SINCE YOU'RE SANDWICHING THREE PHOTOGRAPHS TOGETHER, THEY
 THREE PHOTOGRAPHS TOGETHER, THEY DON'T REGISTER EVENLY.
DON'T REGISTER EVENLY.
SO THERE'S A LOT OF
 SO THERE'S A LOT OF IRREGULARITIES, AND THEN YOU
 IRREGULARITIES, AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE CLOUDS OR ANYTHING
 ALSO HAVE THE CLOUDS OR ANYTHING THAT MOVES WILL CREATE
 THAT MOVES WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT COLOR,
 A DIFFERENT COLOR, 'CAUSE THERE'S TIME BETWEEN
 'CAUSE THERE'S TIME BETWEEN EXPOSURES.
EXPOSURES.
SO THIS CLOUD WAS ONLY RECORDED
 SO THIS CLOUD WAS ONLY RECORDED BY ONE EXPOSURE.
BY ONE EXPOSURE.
THAT'S WHY IT TURNS PINK,
 THAT'S WHY IT TURNS PINK, FOR EXAMPLE.
FOR EXAMPLE.
OR ONE CLOUD WAS ONLY RECORDED
 OR ONE CLOUD WAS ONLY RECORDED BY ANOTHER EXPOSURE.
BY ANOTHER EXPOSURE.
THAT'S WHY IT TURNS YELLOW.
THAT'S WHY IT TURNS YELLOW.
PHOTOGRAPHY USED TO BE LIKE
 PHOTOGRAPHY USED TO BE LIKE ALCHEMY BACK IN THE
 ALCHEMY BACK IN THE 19TH CENTURY.
19TH CENTURY.
IT WAS A MEDIUM OF THE FEW,
 IT WAS A MEDIUM OF THE FEW, AND NOW IT HAS TURNED INTO
 AND NOW IT HAS TURNED INTO A MASS MEDIUM.
A MASS MEDIUM.
MAYBE IT'S REACTIONARY TO TURN
 MAYBE IT'S REACTIONARY TO TURN BACKWARDS AND TO TRY TO
 BACKWARDS AND TO TRY TO ESTABLISH ARTISTRY AGAIN, BUT
 ESTABLISH ARTISTRY AGAIN, BUT IT'S ALSO THE MOST INTERESTING
 IT'S ALSO THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF THE PROCESS AND NOT JUST
 PART OF THE PROCESS AND NOT JUST LIKE THE BLACK BOX,
 LIKE THE BLACK BOX, LIKE A DIGITAL CAMERA.
LIKE A DIGITAL CAMERA.
I NEED TO TREAT EACH PHOTO
 I NEED TO TREAT EACH PHOTO INDIVIDUALLY TO DETERMINE THE
 INDIVIDUALLY TO DETERMINE THE RIGHT SIZE OR SCALE FOR IT.
RIGHT SIZE OR SCALE FOR IT.
SOME OF THE WORKS MIGHT BE HUGE
 SOME OF THE WORKS MIGHT BE HUGE VISTAS, SO I HANG 'EM LOW SO YOU
 VISTAS, SO I HANG 'EM LOW SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK DOWNWARDS TO
 CAN ACTUALLY LOOK DOWNWARDS TO IT, AND IT MIGHT WORK AS A MAP.
IT, AND IT MIGHT WORK AS A MAP.
OR YOU CAN INSPECT EVERY DETAIL.

IT NEEDS TO BE BIG ENOUGH THAT

DISTRACTED BY THE OTHER CORNER.
I DON'T DO SERIAL WORK.
I DON'T DO SERIAL WORK.
I THINK EVERY PIECE NEEDS ITS
 I THINK EVERY PIECE NEEDS ITS OWN PRESENTATION AND SCALE.
OWN PRESENTATION AND SCALE.
I TURNED THE FINISHED PHOTOGRAPH
 I TURNED THE FINISHED PHOTOGRAPH ALMOST BACK INTO A SCRIBBLE
 ALMOST BACK INTO A SCRIBBLE AGAIN.
AGAIN.
USUALLY, A PHOTOGRAPH IS VERY
 USUALLY, A PHOTOGRAPH IS VERY PRECISE, VERY RIGOROUS, AND IT'S
 PRECISE, VERY RIGOROUS, AND IT'S AN END PRODUCT.
AN END PRODUCT.
AND I LIKE TO USE THE END
 AND I LIKE TO USE THE END PRODUCT AND TURN IT INTO
 PRODUCT AND TURN IT INTO AN UNFINISHED STATE AGAIN.
AN UNFINISHED STATE AGAIN.
I THINK IT'S FINE TO COMBINE
 I THINK IT'S FINE TO COMBINE PHOTOGRAPHY AND DRAWING, FOR
 PHOTOGRAPHY AND DRAWING, FOR EXAMPLE, OR ALTER PHOTOGRAPHS
 EXAMPLE, OR ALTER PHOTOGRAPHS AND BRING IN FICTIONAL ELEMENTS,
 AND BRING IN FICTIONAL ELEMENTS, JUST NOT BE SATISFIED WITH
 JUST NOT BE SATISFIED WITH PHOTOGRAPHY AS A FINISHED IMAGE
 PHOTOGRAPHY AS A FINISHED IMAGE OR A SUPER REALISTIC MEDIUM.
OR A SUPER REALISTIC MEDIUM.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF USING THE
 I LIKE THE IDEA OF USING THE COMPUTER TO ACTUALLY BRING IN
 COMPUTER TO ACTUALLY BRING IN IMPERFECTIONS OR TO TURN
 IMPERFECTIONS OR TO TURN A PHOTOGRAPH, A FINISHED IMAGE
 A PHOTOGRAPH, A FINISHED IMAGE INTO A MORE OPEN-ENDED IMAGE SO
 INTO A MORE OPEN-ENDED IMAGE SO THAT IT'S NOT TOO PRECISE OR SO
 THAT IT'S NOT TOO PRECISE OR SO OVERDETERMINED.
OVERDETERMINED.
THE COMPUTER HAS OPENED UP MUCH
 THE COMPUTER HAS OPENED UP MUCH MORE POSSIBILITIES SO YOU CAN
 MORE POSSIBILITIES SO YOU CAN REALLY GO INTO THE PHOTOGRAPH
 REALLY GO INTO THE PHOTOGRAPH TODAY, WHICH WAS HARD TO DO IN
 TODAY, WHICH WAS HARD TO DO IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY.
THE REAL BEGINNING WAS WHEN
 THE REAL BEGINNING WAS WHEN I CAME TO CALIFORNIA,
 I CAME TO CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR
 BECAUSE I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR ITS SCENIC BEAUTY.
ITS SCENIC BEAUTY.
I CAME HERE FOR THE ARTISTS THAT
 I CAME HERE FOR THE ARTISTS THAT WERE TEACHING AT UCLA, AND I
 WERE TEACHING AT UCLA, AND I THOUGHT THE ART THEY WERE DOING
 THOUGHT THE ART THEY WERE DOING WAS EXACTLY THE ART THAT
 WAS EXACTLY THE ART THAT I LIKED.
I LIKED.
I'M ALWAYS KIND OF CRITICAL AND
 I'M ALWAYS KIND OF CRITICAL AND THINK THE WORK IS NOT GOOD
 THINK THE WORK IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH, AND YOU ARE ALWAYS JUST
 ENOUGH, AND YOU ARE ALWAYS JUST THIS POOR PHOTOGRAPHER WHOSE ART
 THIS POOR PHOTOGRAPHER WHOSE ART IS USUALLY CONSIDERED LIKE
 IS USUALLY CONSIDERED LIKE A SIDE PRODUCT.
A SIDE PRODUCT.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE REAL ART.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE REAL ART.
IT'S MORE SOME SORT OF INFERIOR
 IT'S MORE SOME SORT OF INFERIOR ART.
ART.
AT LEAST THAT'S HOW IT IS
 AT LEAST THAT'S HOW IT IS IN GERMANY.
IN GERMANY.
AND MAYBE IN THE U.S.,
 AND MAYBE IN THE U.S., PHOTOGRAPHY'S DEFINITELY MORE
 PHOTOGRAPHY'S DEFINITELY MORE ESTABLISHED, BECAUSE PHOTOGRAPHY
 ESTABLISHED, BECAUSE PHOTOGRAPHY GREW TOGETHER WITH THE DISCOVERY
 GREW TOGETHER WITH THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN WEST.
THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH BY WATKINS
 THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH BY WATKINS THE BEST GENERAL
 THE BEST GENERAL AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS
 AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS PERFECT TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH
 PERFECT TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH FROM GLACIER POINT IN YOSEMITE,
 FROM GLACIER POINT IN YOSEMITE, WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR SPOT
 WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR SPOT TOWARDS HALF DOME, WHICH IS THE
 TOWARDS HALF DOME, WHICH IS THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED MOUNTAIN
 MOST PHOTOGRAPHED MOUNTAIN PROBABLY IN AMERICA, AND NAME IT
 PROBABLY IN AMERICA, AND NAME IT THE BEST GENERAL VIEW.
THE BEST GENERAL VIEW.
I LIKE THE STAGE QUALITY.
I LIKE THE STAGE QUALITY.
IT WASN'T A PERFECT DAY WHEN
 IT WASN'T A PERFECT DAY WHEN I TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH.
I TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH.
IT WAS OVERCAST A LITTLE BIT,
 IT WAS OVERCAST A LITTLE BIT, AND I DIDN'T MIND.
AND I DIDN'T MIND.
IT'S A STARTING POINT.
IT'S A STARTING POINT.
I DREW IN THE ENTIRE BACKGROUND
 I DREW IN THE ENTIRE BACKGROUND WITH THE BLUE SKY AND THE
 WITH THE BLUE SKY AND THE CLOUDS, AND I BROUGHT IN THOSE
 CLOUDS, AND I BROUGHT IN THOSE BUSHES TO BRING IN SOME
 BUSHES TO BRING IN SOME FOREGROUND-BACKGROUND SPACE.
FOREGROUND-BACKGROUND SPACE.
SO IN THE END, EXCEPT FOR HALF
 SO IN THE END, EXCEPT FOR HALF DOME, THE IMAGE IS NOT THE WAY
 DOME, THE IMAGE IS NOT THE WAY IT LOOKED WHEN I TOOK THE
