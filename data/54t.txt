IN KREFELD, GERMANY.
ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE THINGS I'M
 ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE THINGS I'M DOING WITH THE MIES VAN DER ROHE
 DOING WITH THE MIES VAN DER ROHE HAUS IS TO USE HIS MATERIALS IN
 HAUS IS TO USE HIS MATERIALS IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN HE
 A WAY THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN HE WOULD HAVE USED THEM.
WOULD HAVE USED THEM.
AND THE PRINCIPLE MATERIAL HERE
 AND THE PRINCIPLE MATERIAL HERE IS BRICK, WHICH HE WASN'T
 IS BRICK, WHICH HE WASN'T PARTICULARLY FOND OF.
PARTICULARLY FOND OF.
CURIOUSLY, HE DID WORK IN HIS
 CURIOUSLY, HE DID WORK IN HIS FATHER'S BRICKYARD, SO HE DID
 FATHER'S BRICKYARD, SO HE DID HAVE SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THE

MATERIAL.
ALL OF THE OUTSIDE WALLS, WHERE
 ALL OF THE OUTSIDE WALLS, WHERE THERE'S A WINDOW, THEY'RE
 THERE'S A WINDOW, THEY'RE COVERED UP WITH FAKE BRICK.
COVERED UP WITH FAKE BRICK.
SO YOU WILL SEE NO WINDOWS
 SO YOU WILL SEE NO WINDOWS WHATSOEVER.
AND MIES VAN DER ROHE WAS VERY
 AND MIES VAN DER ROHE WAS VERY CAREFUL IN FRAMING THE VIEWS OF
 CAREFUL IN FRAMING THE VIEWS OF THE GARDEN.
WHERE THERE IS A WINDOW IN
 WHERE THERE IS A WINDOW IN THE WALLS, THERE WILL BE
 THE WALLS, THERE WILL BE SUBSTITUTED VIEWS OF THE
 SUBSTITUTED VIEWS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND LANDSCAPE
 PACIFIC OCEAN AND LANDSCAPE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
BUT IN FRONT OF EACH WINDOW,
 BUT IN FRONT OF EACH WINDOW, THERE'LL BE ONE MIES VAN DER
 THERE'LL BE ONE MIES VAN DER ROHE CHAIR WHERE YOU CAN SIT AND
 ROHE CHAIR WHERE YOU CAN SIT AND CONTEMPLATE THE VIEW.
CONTEMPLATE THE VIEW.
THEN IN ONE WALL, I'M HAVING
 THEN IN ONE WALL, I'M HAVING MANUFACTURED AS AN ADDITION
 MANUFACTURED AS AN ADDITION A COUCH IN THE SHAPE OF AN EAR,
 A COUCH IN THE SHAPE OF AN EAR, FLANKED LEFT AND RIGHT BY TWO
 FLANKED LEFT AND RIGHT BY TWO UPTURNED NOSES AS SCONCES
 UPTURNED NOSES AS SCONCES SO THAT YOU'LL EITHER HAVE LIGHT
 SO THAT YOU'LL EITHER HAVE LIGHT OR FLOWERS COMING OUT OF THE

NOSTRILS.
SO I FIGURED IT'S EVERYTHING
 SO I FIGURED IT'S EVERYTHING THAT MIES VAN DER ROHE WOULD
 THAT MIES VAN DER ROHE WOULD HATE.
AND RATHER THAN GLORIFY
 AND RATHER THAN GLORIFY MIES VAN DER ROHE--
 MIES VAN DER ROHE-- HE'S HAD ENOUGH GLORIFICATION--

ACTUALLY, I STARTED USING STILLS
 ACTUALLY, I STARTED USING STILLS FROM MOVIES NOT BECAUSE THEY
 FROM MOVIES NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE FROM THE MOVIES;
 WERE FROM THE MOVIES; I COULD GET THE PICTURES
 I COULD GET THE PICTURES CHEAPLY.
FOR ME, IT'S USING THIS
 FOR ME, IT'S USING THIS DATA BANK OF IMAGES
 DATA BANK OF IMAGES PEOPLE CARRY AROUND IN
 PEOPLE CARRY AROUND IN THEIR HEAD, AND THEN PLAYING AND

 REARRANGING THOSE IMAGES FOR THEM.
A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHS I HAD
 A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHS I HAD BOUGHT WOULD BE FROM NEWSPAPERS.

THAT SORT OF THING.
AND I WAS ATTRACTED BUT REPULSED
 AND I WAS ATTRACTED BUT REPULSED BY THESE, AND I REALIZED WHY
 BY THESE, AND I REALIZED WHY I WAS REPULSED BY THEM WAS THAT
 I WAS REPULSED BY THEM WAS THAT I WAS THERE, ISOLATED IN MY

 ARGUMENTS I HAD WITH ART IN THE FIRST PLACES, THAT, YOU KNOW,
 FIRST PLACES, THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.
I WAS USING THESE PRICE
 I WAS USING THESE PRICE STICKERS, AND I JUST PUT THEM

I THINK MY IDEA IS THIS:
 I THINK MY IDEA IS THIS: NOT SO MUCH STRUCTURE
 NOT SO MUCH STRUCTURE THAT IT'S INHIBITING--I MEAN,
 THAT IT'S INHIBITING--I MEAN, THAT'S THERE'S NO WIGGLE ROOM--
 THAT'S THERE'S NO WIGGLE ROOM-- BUT NOT SO LOOSE THAT

IT'S A CORRAL AROUND YOUR IDEA:
 IT'S A CORRAL AROUND YOUR IDEA: THAT YOU CAN MOVE
 THAT YOU CAN MOVE BUT NOT TOO MUCH.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH.
AND IT'S THAT LIMITED MOVEMENT

 A CERTAIN TRANSCENDENCE OF MYSELF, AND HOPEFULLY
 OF MYSELF, AND HOPEFULLY AUDIENCE DOES TOO.
I WAS, IN THE BEGINNING,
 I WAS, IN THE BEGINNING, THINKING OF DOING KIND OF
 THINKING OF DOING KIND OF A WALKING PERFORMANCE, BUT
 A WALKING PERFORMANCE, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
 I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE AND HOW.
AND HOW.
SO WE JUST WALKED AROUND THE
 SO WE JUST WALKED AROUND THE CITY MORE THAN AN HOUR,
 CITY MORE THAN AN HOUR, JUST WALKING AND WALKING

 BY THE CROWDS AROUND ME, AND MY BODY WAS FULL OF ENERGY
 AND MY BODY WAS FULL OF ENERGY ACCUMULATED BY THIS WALKING
 ACCUMULATED BY THIS WALKING AND THINKING OF PEOPLE.
AND THINKING OF PEOPLE.
SO AT THAT MOMENT, I AWARE THE--
 SO AT THAT MOMENT, I AWARE THE-- THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MY BODY
 THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MY BODY AND THE CROWD IN THE STREET,
 AND THE CROWD IN THE STREET, AND I HAD TO STOP THERE.
AND I HAD TO STOP THERE.
I JUST COULDN'T WALK ANYMORE.
I JUST COULDN'T WALK ANYMORE.
I HAD TO STOP THERE.
MY FIRST VIDEO USING MY OWN BODY
 MY FIRST VIDEO USING MY OWN BODY AS A SYMBOLIC NEEDLE WAS
 AS A SYMBOLIC NEEDLE WAS IN TOKYO, '99.
THAT IS LIKE--ALMOST LIKE
 THAT IS LIKE--ALMOST LIKE PUTTING, INSERTING, A NEEDLE
 PUTTING, INSERTING, A NEEDLE ONTO THE EARTH, IN A WAY.
ONTO THE EARTH, IN A WAY.
AND THAT'S MORE ABOUT MY ENERGY
 AND THAT'S MORE ABOUT MY ENERGY I HAD AT THE TIME.
MY SYSTEM IS VERY MUCH ROOTED TO
 MY SYSTEM IS VERY MUCH ROOTED TO THE PRACTICE OF SEWING, THAT
 THE PRACTICE OF SEWING, THAT USES THE NEEDLE ONTO FABRIC.
I CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT
 I CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT I CAN BE A NEEDLE WOMAN.
I CAN BE A NEEDLE WOMAN.
[laughs]
 I'M USING THE PEDESTRIANS
 I'M USING THE PEDESTRIANS PASSING MOMENT AS SLOW MOTION,
 PASSING MOMENT AS SLOW MOTION, AS IF THEY ARE WEAVED THROUGH
 AS IF THEY ARE WEAVED THROUGH MY BODY AS A NEEDLE.
IT'S NOT ABOUT SHOWING MY
 IT'S NOT ABOUT SHOWING MY IDENTITY, SO IT SHOULD BE FROM
