Janine Antoni is a contemporary artist known for her performative sculptures and installations that explore themes of identity, the body, and transformation. Born in the Bahamas and educated at the Rhode Island School of Design, Antoni emerged in the 1990s with works that pushed the boundaries of sculpture and performance.Antoni's practice is characterized by her use of her own body as a tool for art-making. In works like "Gnaw" (1992), she chewed on large cubes of chocolate and lard, then used the chewed materials to create lipsticks and chocolate boxes. This piece exemplifies her interest in the intersection of sculpture, performance, and everyday rituals.Many of Antoni's works involve labor-intensive processes that leave traces of the body's actions. For "Loving Care" (1993), she mopped a gallery floor with her hair dipped in hair dye, creating an abstract painting through a domestic act. These performances challenge traditional notions of artistic labor and highlight the physicality of art-making.Antoni often works with materials that have personal or cultural significance, such as chocolate, soap, and lard. In "Lick and Lather" (1993), she created busts of herself in chocolate and soap, then licked the chocolate and washed with the soap. This piece explores ideas of self-image, consumption, and the malleability of identity.More recent works by Antoni have incorporated elements of tightrope walking, which she learned as part of her artistic practice. In "Touch" (2002), she filmed herself walking on a tightrope along the horizon line of the ocean. This piece connects to themes of balance, risk, and the relationship between body and landscape that run throughout her work.Antoni's art often invites empathy from viewers by presenting visceral, bodily experiences. She is interested in how meaning is embedded in the process of making and how objects can carry traces of their creation. Through her multifaceted practice, Antoni explores the complexities of human experience, particularly from a female perspective, challenging viewers to reconsider their relationships to their bodies and the world around them.
