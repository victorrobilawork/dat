Mark Dion is an artist whose work explores ideas about nature, science, and museums. He is fascinated by material culture and often incorporates found objects into his installations. Dion sees shopping and collecting as integral parts of his artistic practice.His work is inspired by natural history museums and cabinets of curiosities. He is particularly drawn to older museums that provide insight into how people understood nature in the past. Dion uses artistic tools like humor, irony, and metaphor to examine scientific concepts and practices.A major project by Dion is the "Seattle Vivarium," which involved relocating a fallen hemlock tree from a forest to an urban art space. The piece aims to highlight the complexity of natural systems and the difficulty of replicating them. It incorporates elaborate systems for maintaining the log's ecosystem within a controlled environment.Dion sees his role as holding up a mirror to society's relationship with nature rather than imagining utopian futures. He views contemporary art as a critical foil to dominant culture, with science functioning as a worldview for artists similar to how theology informed Renaissance art.His artistic process often involves collaboration with scientists, architects, and other specialists. Dion compares directing these large-scale projects to filmmaking. He aims to create immersive, evolving installations that provoke questions and emphasize nature as an ongoing process.Dion's work challenges viewers to consider humanity's impact on the environment and the impossibility of fully recreating destroyed ecosystems. He hopes to motivate engagement through a sense of wonder rather than didacticism. His pieces often require long-term commitment, as they involve living elements that change over time.
