Kerry James Marshall is a renowned African American painter known for his powerful depictions of black figures and exploration of African American history and culture. Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1955, Marshall spent his childhood in Los Angeles where he developed his passion for art. A pivotal moment came in kindergarten when Marshall's teacher showed him a scrapbook of images that moved him to tears and inspired him to become an artist. Later, as a teenager, he received a scholarship to take drawing classes at Otis Art Institute. There he encountered the work of Charles White, one of the first black artists Marshall had seen represented in art books. Seeing White's studio and works in progress was formative for Marshall.Marshall's paintings often feature very dark-skinned figures, which has sometimes been controversial. For him, this unequivocal blackness is both beautiful and powerful. He sees it as reclaiming blackness as an emblem of strength. Marshall draws inspiration from classical painting traditions, adopting similar compositional structures to give his work comparable authority.In addition to painting, Marshall works in other media like film, photography and comics. He sees all these forms as compatible, either working with or against established conventions. Marshall is interested in finding ways to make traditional art forms feel fresh and relevant.One of Marshall's current projects involves creating a comic strip featuring African sculptures reimagined as superheroes. This combines his childhood love of Marvel comics with a desire to revitalize and carry forward African artistic traditions. Marshall's work consistently aims to address underrepresentation of black subjects and experiences in Western art history while celebrating African American culture.
