Jessica Stockholder is a contemporary artist known for her vibrant, playful sculptural installations that blur the lines between painting, sculpture, and architecture. She approaches her work with a sense of spontaneity and experimentation, embracing chaos and intuition in her creative process. Stockholder's artistic journey began unconventionally - she initially worked in carpentry, helping build a floating bridge in Seattle. This hands-on experience with materials and construction informed her later artistic practice. She went on to study art formally, developing her distinctive style of colorful, abstract assemblages.In her work, Stockholder uses a wide range of everyday materials and found objects, from plastic containers to furniture to light bulbs. She is particularly drawn to plastic for its ubiquity in modern culture and its embodiment of color. Her installations engage directly with architectural spaces, often incorporating elements of the existing environment.Stockholder sees her artistic process as a form of play and exploration without predetermined ends. She values the discomfort and uncertainty inherent in creating, viewing it as rich territory for discovery. While her work appears chaotic, she is deeply interested in systems, geometry, and the tension between planned structures and meandering thought processes.Themes of pleasure, joy, and fantasy run through Stockholder's oeuvre. She aims to create immersive environments that offer viewers new perceptual experiences and imaginative possibilities. At the same time, her use of common materials grounds the work in the familiar physical world.Throughout her career, Stockholder has moved between smaller studio-based works and large-scale site-specific installations. She sees drawing as an important part of her practice, using it to map out ideas and visualize spatial relationships. Her approach involves responding intuitively to materials and spaces while also carefully considering color relationships and compositional balance.Stockholder's work invites multiple interpretations, operating on visual, emotional, and conceptual levels simultaneously. She is interested in how art institutions both enable and constrain artistic expression. Overall, her practice celebrates the transformative power of art to reframe everyday experiences and spark joy and wonder.
