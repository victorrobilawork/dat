Ursula von Rydingsvard is a sculptor who works primarily with cedar wood. She grew up in post-World War II refugee camps in Germany as one of seven children in a Polish family. This experience deeply influenced her art, as she absorbed information visually rather than verbally in her childhood environment. Von Rydingsvard builds her large-scale sculptures layer by layer, drawing each piece and having her studio team cut and assemble them. She sees the surface of her works as a kind of emotional or psychological landscape. She uses graphite powder to add texture and definition to the cedar.Her process is very labor-intensive and repetitive. She never makes models or drawings beforehand, preferring to keep her options open as she works. Anger has been a motivating force in her art. She aims to create a sense of struggle or combat within her pieces, balancing agitation with lyricism.Von Rydingsvard draws inspiration from utilitarian objects and vernacular forms, but her sculptures are not functional. She is interested in fusing man-made and natural elements. Some of her works incorporate translucent materials to play with light.Her artistic approach involves embracing opposites and contradictions within a single work. She sees value in both chaos and order, agony and gentleness. For von Rydingsvard, the creative process requires remaining open to surprises and new directions as a piece develops.
