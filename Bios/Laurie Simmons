Laurie Simmons is a visual artist known for her photography and film work exploring themes of nostalgia, gender roles, and artifice. Born in 1949, Simmons studied at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. In the late 1970s, she began creating staged photographs using dolls and miniature props, juxtaposing furniture, walls, and everyday objects to create surreal domestic scenes. These early works were often devoid of people, reflecting Simmons' sense that life felt chaotic. A key aspect of Simmons' practice is using photography as an artistic tool rather than pursuing traditional photography. Her work aims to freeze quiet, pristine moments amidst the chaos of life. In the 1990s, Simmons created a series called "Clothes Make the Man" using ventriloquist dummies to explore themes of identity and appearance.More recently, Simmons has expanded into filmmaking. Her 2006 film The Music of Regret allowed her to bring her photographic work to life, casting Meryl Streep as a version of herself. The film explores themes of love, family, and regret through musical vignettes featuring both human actors and puppets. For Simmons, this project enabled her to tap into the theatrical, narrative inner life she had always imagined for her photographs but had been hesitant to express directly.Simmons' work often grapples with nostalgia, particularly for mid-20th century American culture. She is interested in exploring how memory and fantasy shape our perceptions of the past. Music plays an important role in her practice, with Simmons often having songs in mind while creating her visual works. Throughout her career, Simmons has pushed boundaries between different artistic mediums, moving fluidly between photography, film, and music. Her work invites viewers to question the line between reality and artifice, encouraging us to examine how we construct narratives about our lives and memories. By bringing inanimate objects to life and exploring themes of regret and lost opportunities, Simmons creates poignant reflections on the human experience.
