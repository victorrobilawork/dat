He is particularly known for his long-exposure seascape photographs, which he describes as a way of witnessing "the creation of the universe." Sugimoto spends weeks at a time at various seaside locations, becoming part of the landscape as he captures these serene, minimalist images.The artist discusses his traditional approach to photography, preferring natural light and manual techniques over digital technology. He sees his process as a form of "fossilization of time," drawing parallels between photography and the preservation of ancient life forms.Sugimoto's interests extend beyond photography to include sculpture, architecture, and collecting. He has a deep fascination with scientific and mathematical models, which he incorporates into his artistic practice. The artist also discusses his engagement with Shinto spirituality and his commission to rebuild a Shinto shrine in Japan.A significant influence on Sugimoto's work is Marcel Duchamp, particularly "The Large Glass." Sugimoto has created his own interpretations of this seminal work, demonstrating how Duchamp's ideas continue to resonate in contemporary art.Sugimoto emphasizes the importance of exhibition design in presenting his work, treating each show as a holistic spatial experience. He sees his role as an artist as making the impossible visible, translating his unique visual understanding into experiences that can be shared with others.Throughout his career, Sugimoto has consistently pushed the boundaries of photography, creating images that challenge our perception of time and reality. His work bridges Eastern and Western artistic traditions, science and spirituality, the ancient and the modern.
