Sally Mann is a photographer known for her intimate portraits of her family and evocative landscapes of the American South. She grew up in Lexington, Virginia in an unconventional household - her father was an atheist doctor and art collector, while her mother came from a blue-blood New England background. As a child, Mann ran wild and naked, surrounded by dogs. This upbringing influenced her later photography of her own children in similar unclothed, natural states.Mann studied at Bennington College and worked as a photographer at Washington and Lee University. She gained fame and controversy in the 1990s for her book "Immediate Family," featuring nude photos of her young children. Mann sees her photographic process as very spontaneous, capturing moments as they naturally occur. She is drawn to ambiguity and imperfection in her images.In recent years, Mann has focused on landscape photography of the South, using antique cameras and the 19th century collodion wet plate process. She is interested in themes of memory, place, and the passage of time. Mann's work often deals with difficult subjects like death and racial history. She aims to create dreamlike, evocative images that prompt reflection in viewers. Mann sees her photography as a way of exploring her own identity and relationship to the Southern landscape.
