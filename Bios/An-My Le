An-My Lê is a Vietnamese-American photographer known for her exploration of war, conflict, and military culture. Born in Saigon in 1960, Lê fled Vietnam with her family in 1975, eventually settling in the United States. She studied biology at Stanford University before discovering her passion for photography, later earning an MFA from Yale University.Lê's work is deeply influenced by her experiences as a refugee and her complex relationship with Vietnam. Her photography often blurs the lines between documentary and staged scenes, challenging viewers' perceptions of war and its representation. Lê uses a large-format camera, which requires careful composition and creates highly detailed images.One of Lê's most notable projects, "Small Wars" (1999-2002), documented Vietnam War reenactors in North Carolina. This series explored the intersection of history, memory, and fantasy in American culture. Another significant work, "29 Palms" (2003-2004), captured military training exercises in the California desert, serving as a stand-in for the Iraq War.Lê's approach to war photography is unique in its focus on preparation and aftermath rather than active combat. She is interested in the landscape as a witness to history and how military activities shape the environment. Her work often emphasizes the scale of military operations in relation to the human figure.In recent years, Lê has continued to explore military themes, photographing U.S. Navy ships and marine training exercises. Her work has been exhibited widely and is held in major museum collections. Lê has received numerous awards, including a MacArthur "Genius" Fellowship in 2012.Throughout her career, An-My Lê has grappled with the complexities of war, refusing to present simple narratives or take overtly political stances. Instead, her work invites viewers to contemplate the ongoing presence of conflict in our world and its far-reaching effects on landscapes and societies.
