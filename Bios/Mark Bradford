Mark Bradford is a contemporary American artist known for his large-scale abstract paintings and collage-based works. Born in 1961 in Los Angeles, Bradford grew up helping in his mother's hair salon, which influenced his artistic practice. He began his art education later in life, attending Santa Monica College before transferring to the California Institute of the Arts, where he received his BFA in 1995 and his MFA in 1997. Bradford's artistic approach combines collage and d√©collage techniques. He builds up layers of paper and other materials, then sands, tears, and scrapes them away to reveal complex, map-like compositions. His materials often include merchant posters, billboard paper, and other urban ephemera collected from his South Los Angeles neighborhood. This process of adding and subtracting layers reflects Bradford's interest in the archaeology of place and how communities are shaped over time.Many of Bradford's works engage with social and political issues, particularly related to marginalized communities. Pieces like "Black Venus" and "Los Moscos" explore themes of race, gender, and class through abstract forms inspired by urban topography. His "Practice" video, featuring him dribbling a basketball in an antebellum hoop skirt, addresses intersections of race, gender, and athleticism.Bradford sees his labor-intensive process as a way to slow down and hear his inner creative voice. He approaches each piece as a problem to be solved, often not knowing exactly how it will turn out. This experimental attitude stems partly from his background in jazz, which he played before becoming a visual artist. Bradford's work has earned him numerous accolades, including a MacArthur "Genius" Grant in 2009. His pieces are held in major museum collections worldwide, and he represented the United States at the 2017 Venice Biennale. Through his abstract yet socially engaged practice, Bradford continues to explore the complexities of urban life and identity in contemporary America.
