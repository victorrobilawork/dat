Cao Fei is a Chinese multimedia artist known for her work in video, digital media, and installation. She grew up in a rapidly changing China, where pop culture was spreading into every corner of the country. This fluid and mobile environment, where cultures mix and diverge, has significantly influenced her artistic practice.Cao's early artistic influences came from street culture, hip-hop music, and dance. She sees street culture as a natural, wild, free, and spontaneous form of expression. This background has led her to approach art with a sense of humor and a tendency to mix different elements together, much like sampling in hip-hop music.After graduating from college, Cao's early works were characterized by a direct critique of reality, reflecting her first exposures to the working world. Over time, her approach evolved to reflect a more thorough understanding of society as a whole.Cao's work often explores the gap between generations in China, as seen in her project "Cosplayers." This work examines how younger generations use role-playing to express discontent with their real-life roles and the disconnect between them and older generations.In her project "Whose Utopia," Cao worked within a factory setting to explore the realities of workers' lives and their fantasies. This project exemplifies her interest in examining reality from multiple angles and exploring how individuals seek opportunities for survival and self-expression within constrained circumstances.Cao's engagement with digital worlds is a significant aspect of her practice. She created an avatar named China Tracy to explore Second Life, a virtual world. This led to her documentary "iMirror," which explores the intense emotions and unbridled nature of digital interactions.One of Cao's most ambitious projects is "RMB City," a virtual city she created in Second Life. This project explores ideas of urban development, investment, and overdevelopment in a digital space. It also serves as a platform for experimenting with utopian practices and democratic ideals.Throughout her career, Cao has been interested in the connections between past and present, and between Asian and Western cultures. Her work often incorporates elements of traditional Chinese aesthetics while engaging with contemporary digital technologies and global pop culture.Cao Fei's artistic practice is characterized by its engagement with digital media, its exploration of the rapidly changing realities of contemporary China, and its interest in the fantasies and aspirations of individuals within these shifting contexts. Her work provides a unique perspective on the intersections of technology, culture, and personal identity in the 21st century.
