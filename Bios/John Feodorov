John Feodorov is a contemporary Native American artist known for his provocative mixed-media works that explore the complexities of indigenous identity in modern America. Born to a Navajo mother and a Russian-American father, Feodorov's upbringing straddled two very different cultural worlds. He spent summers on the Navajo reservation with his grandparents, immersed in traditional practices, while also being raised as a Jehovah's Witness off the reservation.This dual heritage forms the core of Feodorov's artistic practice. He creates works that blend elements of Native American spirituality with pop culture and consumerism, often using humor and irony to address serious issues. Feodorov's art challenges stereotypes about Native Americans and critiques the commodification of indigenous cultures.Feodorov studied at the California College of Arts and Crafts (now California College of the Arts) in Oakland. His artistic approach is deeply influenced by his experiences navigating between Navajo and mainstream American cultures. He often incorporates found objects, kitsch items, and mass-produced goods into his sculptures and installations, creating hybrid forms that reflect his own hybrid identity.A recurring theme in Feodorov's work is the tension between traditional Native spirituality and modern consumer culture. He creates pieces that playfully subvert New Age appropriations of Native American practices, such as his "Totem Teddy" series, which transforms cute teddy bears into powerful totem symbols that can be purchased as consumer products.Feodorov's art also addresses environmental issues, particularly the exploitation of Native lands. He uses his work to critique corporate greed and the destruction of sacred sites. Through his provocative and often humorous pieces, Feodorov encourages viewers to question their assumptions about Native American culture and spirituality.As an educator and artist, Feodorov continues to challenge perceptions and spark dialogue about indigenous identity in contemporary society. His work has been exhibited widely and is held in numerous public and private collections. Feodorov's unique perspective as a bicultural artist allows him to create powerful, thought-provoking works that bridge cultural divides and confront important social issues.
