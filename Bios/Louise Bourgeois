Louise Bourgeois was a French-American artist known for her sculptural works exploring themes of childhood, family, sexuality and the body. Born in Paris in 1911, Bourgeois moved to New York in 1938 where she lived and worked until her death in 2010 at age 98.Bourgeois's art was deeply autobiographical, often dealing with her childhood experiences and family dynamics. Her father's infidelity and her mother's death profoundly influenced her work. Bourgeois began her artistic career as a painter and engraver before moving to sculpture in the 1940s.Growing up, Bourgeois was exposed to the tapestry restoration business run by her parents. Though her feminist mother forbade her from working with textiles, seeing it as limiting for women, Bourgeois later incorporated fabric and needlework into her art. She saw this as reclaiming and elevating traditionally feminine crafts.Bourgeois worked across a wide range of materials including wood, bronze, marble, and later in life, fabric. Her sculptures often featured organic, bodily forms and explored themes of vulnerability, protection and ambivalence in human relationships. Hands were a recurring motif, representing both helplessness and the ability to offer help.In her later years, Bourgeois created several large-scale installation works she called "Cells," enclosed room-like spaces filled with symbolic objects. She continued working prolifically into her 90s, including on public commissions like her giant spider sculptures.Bourgeois believed strongly in the emotional power of art. She felt a work was successful if it elicited feeling in the viewer, even if its specific meaning couldn't be explained. For her, art-making was a way of working through psychological states and experiences. Bourgeois saw the artist as someone who retained a childlike quality, either by choice or inability to fully grow up.
