Nancy Spero was an American artist known for her politically charged, feminist artwork. Born in 1926, Spero studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and later in Paris. Her early work was influenced by existentialism and the horrors of World War II. In the 1960s, Spero began creating her iconic "War Series" in response to the Vietnam War, featuring helicopters as symbols of American military power. Spero's art often focused on themes of violence, oppression, and the female experience. She developed a unique visual language incorporating text and appropriated imagery from various cultures and time periods. Her work frequently featured processions of female figures, drawn from sources ranging from ancient Egyptian art to contemporary media.In the 1970s, Spero abandoned canvas in favor of paper scrolls and friezes, allowing her to create narrative sequences and challenge traditional artistic formats. She pioneered the use of repetitive printing techniques to create rhythmic, dance-like compositions. Spero saw her art as a form of protest and a way to give voice to marginalized groups, especially women.Throughout her career, Spero collaborated closely with her husband, artist Leon Golub. Their partnership was both personal and intellectual, with each influencing the other's work. Spero described the challenge of working alongside such a prominent artist, but ultimately found her own artistic voice through intimate, small-scale works that contrasted with Golub's large paintings.Spero's later installations, such as "Maypole: Take No Prisoners" (2007), continued to address themes of war and violence while experimenting with three-dimensional forms. Her work has been exhibited internationally and is held in major museum collections. Nancy Spero passed away in 2009, leaving behind a powerful legacy as a pioneering feminist artist and activist.
