Do-Ho Suh is a Korean artist known for his sculptural installations exploring themes of home, identity, and cultural displacement. Born in 1962 in Seoul, Suh grew up in a traditional Korean house built by his father, a famous painter. This childhood home would later become a central motif in Suh's work.Suh studied Oriental painting at Seoul National University before moving to the United States in 1991 to continue his art education. He received a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1994 and an MFA from Yale University in 1997. This experience of cultural transition profoundly impacted Suh's artistic practice.Much of Suh's work deals with his sense of displacement as a Korean living in the West. His "Seoul Home/L.A. Home" project recreates his childhood home in fabric, allowing him to "carry" it with him. Suh sees this as a way of actively dealing with homesickness rather than passively longing for home.Suh is interested in the notion of personal space and how it differs across cultures. His installations often play with scale, using miniature figures or architectural forms to explore the relationship between the individual and the collective. Works like "Floor" use thousands of tiny plastic figures to support a glass floor, questioning ideas of anonymity and shared burdens.Military service, which is mandatory for Korean men, is another recurring theme in Suh's work. Pieces like "Some/One" use dog tags to create imposing sculptural forms, reflecting on issues of identity and conformity within military culture.Suh's work is characterized by meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail. He often collaborates with skilled artisans to realize his complex designs. Through his art, Suh aims to create a "critical distance" that allows viewers to see familiar spaces and concepts in new ways, bridging cultural divides through shared human experiences.
