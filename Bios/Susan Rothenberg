Susan Rothenberg is an American painter known for her distinctive horse imagery and abstract style. She studied art at Cornell University and moved to New York City in the 1970s, where she became part of the avant-garde art scene. Rothenberg's early career was defined by her iconic horse paintings, which she saw as a way to explore formal artistic concerns while using a recognizable subject. In the 1980s, Rothenberg moved to New Mexico with her husband, artist Bruce Nauman. The change in landscape and light profoundly impacted her work. She began incorporating more color and experimenting with different perspectives, often looking down on her subjects from above. Rothenberg's process involves constantly reworking her paintings, building up layers and making adjustments until she feels satisfied with the result.Rothenberg discusses how she uses color in her work, preferring to "dirty down" bright hues and work with muted tones. Red and "dirty white" are particular favorites. She explains that her paintings evolve organically, with each new work carrying through elements from previous pieces. Rothenberg emphasizes the importance of being in the studio every day, even if just to make small adjustments, to keep the creative process flowing.The artist reflects on her unexpected path, noting that those who knew her in her youth would be surprised by her solitary, focused life as a painter. She credits the interdisciplinary art world of 1970s New York with shaping her early career. Overall, Rothenberg's work explores themes of memory, physicality, and the tension between abstraction and representation. Her unique visual language has made her one of the most influential painters of her generation.
