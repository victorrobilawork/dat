Ida Applebroog is an American artist known for her multimedia works exploring themes of power, gender, and violence. She was born in the Bronx, New York in 1929 and studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Applebroog changed her name from Applebaum as a way to create her own identity separate from male-derived names.Applebroog's artistic practice spans painting, drawing, sculpture, and book arts. She came of age as an artist in the 1950s, when women were largely invisible in the art world. This experience shaped her interest in examining power dynamics in her work, particularly between men and women, parents and children, and institutions and individuals.In the 1970s, Applebroog developed a unique approach of creating and mailing out small handmade books to strangers as a way to reenter the art world after moving back to New York. She uses repetition of images in her work to create a sense of animation or film-like progression.Thematically, Applebroog's work often addresses difficult subjects like violence, abuse, and social injustice. She aims to draw viewers in with beautiful painterly techniques, then confront them with challenging content that requires deeper reflection.In recent years, Applebroog has embraced digital technology in her artistic practice, learning to use computers and printers to create new forms of work. She sees this as simply another tool for art-making, no different from painting or sculpting.Throughout her career, Applebroog has resisted labels and categorization of her work. She considers herself simply an artist who makes art in whatever form is necessary to express her ideas. Applebroog continues to find new creative inspiration late in life, experiencing what she describes as a "reawakening" of her artistic energies.
