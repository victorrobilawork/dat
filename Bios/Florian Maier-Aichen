Florian Maier-Aichen is a German-born photographer and artist known for his large-scale, manipulated landscape photographs that blur the line between photography and painting. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), drawn there by the artists teaching at the school and the art they were producing.Maier-Aichen's approach to photography is unconventional. He views the camera as a starting point rather than an end in itself, often extensively manipulating his images after they are taken. His process involves drawing on the photographs, enhancing them, and constructing them to a degree that moves beyond strict representation into a more idealized or abstracted realm.The artist's work is heavily influenced by the history of photography, particularly its role in documenting the American West. He is interested in how photography has evolved from an alchemical process practiced by few to a mass medium, and his work often seeks to reintroduce elements of artistry and imperfection into the medium.Maier-Aichen frequently employs historical photographic techniques, such as tricolor photography, to create images with unique color effects and imperfections. He sees these techniques as a way to open up the photographic image, making it less precise and overdetermined.His subjects often include landscapes and scenes that have been extensively photographed, such as Yosemite National Park. However, Maier-Aichen approaches these familiar subjects in novel ways, sometimes completely reconstructing elements of the scene or introducing abstract elements.The artist is particularly interested in the intersection of abstraction and representation, often combining both in a single image. He draws inspiration from various sources, including old postcards, maps, and historical photographs, using these as starting points for his own imaginative reconstructions.Maier-Aichen's work also engages with themes of failure and hidden histories, as seen in his photographs of the St. Francis Dam disaster site. He is interested in revealing aspects of landscapes and histories that are often overlooked or deliberately obscured.Throughout his career, Maier-Aichen has sought to push the boundaries of what photography can be, creating works that challenge viewers' expectations and blur the lines between different artistic media. His approach to photography is both analytical and intuitive, combining technical skill with a strong sense of imagination and a deep engagement with the history and potential of the medium.
