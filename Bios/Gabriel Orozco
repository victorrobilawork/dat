Gabriel Orozco is a Mexican-born contemporary artist known for his diverse and conceptual approach to art-making. Raised in Mexico City, Orozco developed an early fascination with observing details in urban environments. This interest in everyday objects and spaces became central to his artistic practice.Orozco does not maintain a traditional studio, preferring to work directly in the world. He sees the lack of a fixed workspace as a way to stay connected to reality and confront the world directly. Orozco works across various media, including sculpture, photography, drawing, and installation. He approaches each project as a beginner, often learning new skills or techniques as needed.A key aspect of Orozco's work is his interest in games and play. He has created modified versions of games like billiards and ping pong, using them as a way to explore ideas about space, chance, and human interaction. For example, his "Oval Billiard Table" introduces elements of unpredictability into the normally precise game of billiards.Orozco is also known for his interventions in everyday objects. His piece "La DS" involved cutting a CitroÃ«n DS car lengthwise and reassembling it as a narrower version, creating a surreal object that challenges perceptions of familiar forms. Similarly, his "Yogurt Caps" series placed empty yogurt lids on walls, transforming mundane objects into minimalist sculptures.Photography plays a significant role in Orozco's practice, serving as a tool for awareness and observation. He uses the camera to document fleeting moments and overlooked details in urban environments. These photographs often capture poetic juxtapositions or subtle interventions in public spaces.Orozco's work blurs the line between art and everyday life, encouraging viewers to see the world around them in new ways. He is interested in the spaces between defined categories - work and leisure, public and private, art and non-art. Through his diverse projects, Orozco invites audiences to reconsider their relationships to objects, spaces, and social interactions.
