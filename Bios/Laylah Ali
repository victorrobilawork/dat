Laylah Ali is an American artist known for her precise, stylized gouache paintings depicting enigmatic figures and scenes. She was born in Buffalo, New York and grew up in a working-class family. Ali studied art and received her MFA from Washington University in St. Louis.Ali's artistic practice is heavily influenced by her childhood experiences watching cartoons and television. Her distinctive visual style features simplified, two-dimensional figures reminiscent of cartoons or pictographs. However, Ali emphasizes that her work is not an escapist fantasy, but rather closely connected to real-world issues and her own life experiences.Her creative process involves extensive planning and meticulous execution. Ali keeps detailed notebooks outlining her painting process and uses a rigorous system of color-coding her brushes. She creates preliminary drawings to work out ideas, but the final paintings are much more studied and controlled.Thematically, Ali's work often explores power dynamics, violence, and racial identity. Growing up as the only black child in a white school influenced her perspective on these issues. Her paintings frequently depict ambiguous scenes of conflict or tension between simplified figures.Ali is interested in how visual elements like color and facial features affect viewers' interpretations of figures. By removing or altering certain features, she explores how much can be conveyed through minimal visual information. Her work invites viewers to closely examine the subtle details and gestures of her figures.While Ali maintains tight control over her painting process, she finds that successful works take on a life of their own, developing an unexpected energy or presence. This tension between control and unpredictability is an important aspect of her practice.
