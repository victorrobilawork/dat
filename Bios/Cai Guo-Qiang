Cai Guo-Qiang is a Chinese artist known for his innovative use of gunpowder in his artwork. He was born in Quanzhou, China and studied stage design at the Shanghai Theater Academy. Cai's artistic practice is deeply influenced by Eastern philosophy and his childhood experiences during the Cultural Revolution in China. Cai's signature technique involves using gunpowder to create explosive events and gunpowder drawings. He sees gunpowder as a material that embodies both creative and destructive forces. Cai describes his process of working with gunpowder as "flowing with the material" and allowing it to take him where it wants to go, despite its unpredictable and dangerous nature.His father, who was a painter and calligrapher, had a significant influence on Cai's artistic development. Cai was particularly inspired by his father's miniature matchbox paintings, which taught him that art is about more than just what is explicitly depicted. Cai's work often explores themes of Eastern philosophy, Chinese culture and history, destruction and creation. He is interested in eliciting visceral responses from viewers through visual impact. Many of his installations and projects, like the sunken boat piece in Washington D.C., examine ideas of destruction, decay, and impermanence.Cai sees his artistic practice as a way to honestly reflect on contemporary society and cultural-political issues. He aims to depict intangible forces and ideas that profoundly affect us but are difficult to represent visually. His work is infused with ancient Chinese philosophical concepts like constant change and allowing uncertainties to exist.
