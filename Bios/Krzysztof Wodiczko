Krzysztof Wodiczko is a Polish artist known for his large-scale video projections on architectural facades and monuments. He was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1943, during World War II. His mother was Jewish and lost her entire family in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. These early experiences of war and its aftermath deeply influenced Wodiczko's artistic practice.Wodiczko studied industrial design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw and later emigrated to Canada in 1977. He is known for his socially engaged public art projects that often address issues of trauma, memory, and human rights.His signature technique involves projecting video images of people's faces and hands onto buildings and monuments. These projections aim to give voice to marginalized groups and address difficult social issues in public spaces. Wodiczko carefully plans the visual integration of the projected images with the architectural features of the buildings.Many of Wodiczko's projects involve collaborating with local communities and encouraging participants to share personal stories related to violence, loss, and social injustice. He sees these public projections as a way for people to break the "code of silence" and speak about difficult experiences in a supportive environment.Wodiczko's work often engages with the historical and symbolic significance of the buildings and monuments he projects onto. For example, his Hiroshima projection used one of the few surviving structures from the atomic bombing to share stories from present-day Hiroshima residents.Throughout his career, Wodiczko has grappled with how to ethically engage with traumatic subject matter. He uses techniques like sketching to maintain some emotional distance from the difficult stories he encounters in his work. Ultimately, Wodiczko aims to create public spaces for healing and dialogue around challenging social issues.
