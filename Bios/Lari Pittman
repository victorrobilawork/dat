Lari Pittman is a contemporary American artist known for his intricate, layered paintings that blend diverse cultural influences. Born in 1952 in Los Angeles to a Colombian mother and American father, Pittman spent his formative years in Colombia before returning to California. This multicultural upbringing deeply influenced his artistic sensibility, instilling in him an appreciation for hybridity and decorative arts.Pittman studied at California Institute of the Arts, receiving his BFA in 1974 and MFA in 1976. His early experiences, including being allowed to express his "fey side" as a child, laid the groundwork for the ornate, decorative style that would become his signature. Pittman's work is characterized by its dense, chaotic compositions that incorporate elements from folk art, religious iconography, and commercial design.As a gay artist working in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Pittman's work often engages with themes of sexuality, identity, and cultural politics. He views his artistic practice as a form of resistance against homophobia and discrimination, using vibrant colors and intricate patterns to create affirming, celebratory images.Pittman's paintings often incorporate text and symbolic imagery, creating complex narratives that invite multiple interpretations. He draws inspiration from diverse sources, including Mexican retablos (devotional paintings on tin), cactus gardens, and the visual culture of Los Angeles. His work challenges traditional hierarchies between "high" and "low" art, embracing decorative and applied arts techniques.Throughout his career, Pittman has been interested in pushing the boundaries of painting. He approaches each canvas as a linguistic construct, thinking in terms of nouns, adjectives, and verbs to create dynamic compositions. His recent work has increasingly incorporated elements from his personal life, including his garden, while maintaining a sense of allegory and metaphor.Pittman's artistic process is meticulous and labor-intensive. He refuses to leave a painting until it feels complete, often working on a single piece for months. This dedication reflects his belief in the transformative power of art and his desire to "fix up" painting as a medium.As an educator and influential figure in the Los Angeles art scene, Pittman has helped shape contemporary painting discourse. His work celebrates complexity, hybridity, and the power of visual language to convey emotion and challenge societal norms.
