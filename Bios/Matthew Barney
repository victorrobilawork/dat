He often appears as various characters undergoing bizarre transformations. The title refers to the cremaster muscle that controls testicular contrition in males, which Barney uses as a metaphor for artistic creation and sexual differentiation.Barney's work is known for its cryptic symbolism, nonlinear narratives and stunning visuals. He incorporates diverse influences from sports to opera to create immersive multimedia experiences. His films blur the lines between cinema, performance art and sculpture.In addition to filmmaking, Barney creates intricate drawings, photographs and sculptures related to his film projects. He uses unusual materials like petroleum jelly and tapioca in his sculptural works. Barney sees his entire artistic output as an interconnected system.Barney's father describes him as extremely focused and goal-oriented from a young age. He originally wanted to be a plastic surgeon before pursuing art. His father notes Barney seems to lack the fears that hold others back, tackling ambitious projects head-on.While polarizing to some critics, Barney is considered one of the most important contemporary artists working today.
