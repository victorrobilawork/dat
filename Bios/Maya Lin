Maya Lin is an American architect, sculptor and environmental artist best known for designing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. Born in Ohio in 1959, Lin comes from a family of artists and scholars who emigrated from China. Lin's work often blends art and architecture, with a focus on site-specific installations that respond to and reshape landscapes. Many of her sculptures deal with naturally occurring phenomena and are closely aligned with geology and earth formations. She is interested in the interplay between indoor and outdoor spaces.After the massive public attention from the Vietnam Memorial, which she designed as a 21-year-old undergraduate, Lin struggled against being pigeonholed as a creator of monuments. She has worked to establish herself as both an artist and architect, though she is selective about architectural projects to maintain time for her art practice.One of Lin's recent projects is redesigning a park in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Rather than creating a single sculpture, she approached it holistically - reworking the entire space including buildings, lighting, and landscaping. The centerpiece is a skating rink surrounded by terraced rings inspired by water ripples and astronomy.In her studio practice, Lin often works with books and maps, carving into them to create miniature landscapes. She sees this intimate work as a counterpoint to her large-scale public projects. Lin views her artistic development as an ongoing process of integrating her interests in art, architecture, and the natural world.Lin's approach emphasizes subtlety and integration with the environment rather than monumental statements. She aims to create spaces and objects that encourage reflection and new ways of perceiving the landscape. Her work continues to evolve, exploring themes of time, memory, and our relationship to the natural world.
