Jeff Koons is a contemporary American artist known for his large-scale sculptures and paintings that often incorporate elements of pop culture and kitsch. He began his artistic career after studying at the Maryland Institute College of Art and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Koons describes his artistic process as metaphysical, aiming to create works that can transport viewers in a "soulful, rich way." He employs a large team of assistants to help produce his technically complex works, though he emphasizes that very few paintings are made each year due to the time-intensive process. His studio operates as a kind of community, which Koons sees as an extension of his self-reliant nature developed in childhood when he would go door-to-door selling gift wrap and candy. This early experience instilled in him a desire for communication and interaction that carries through to his art practice today.Koons' works often explore themes of acceptance, sensuality, and spirituality. He is interested in how objects can serve as metaphors for people and how art can connect viewers to human history. His creative process involves extensive digital manipulation and color correction before paintings are meticulously reproduced by his team using a system of numbered color maps.While some perceive Koons as having a large factory churning out work, he stresses the limited production and intensive labor that goes into each piece. His goal is to create art that empowers viewers and communicates as strongly and clearly as possible, while maintaining a moral responsibility to respect others. Koons sees his role as an artist as embracing all the tools available to create powerful, virile works that can still uplift and connect with audiences.
