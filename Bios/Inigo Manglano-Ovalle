Inigo Manglano-Ovalle is an artist who explores the intersection of art, architecture, and science in his work. He sees art as a platform for provoking thought and debate rather than conveying a specific message. His pieces often have underlying political themes, but he aims to avoid revealing his own position explicitly.Manglano-Ovalle has a strong connection to architecture, particularly the work of Mies van der Rohe. His video piece "Le Baiser" features him washing windows at Mies's Farnsworth House, exploring themes of modernism, labor, and separation. He is interested in weather patterns and how they interact with architecture. For his piece "Random Sky," he worked with scientists to create a visualization of real-time weather data on the facade of a building. This project exemplifies his collaborative approach, bringing together artists, composers, and researchers.Manglano-Ovalle's work often involves scaling up everyday objects or capturing ephemeral phenomena. He created a large bulletproof umbrella and a sculpture of a thunderstorm frozen in time. These pieces play with ideas of protection, instability, and the impossibility of truly capturing nature.His background as an immigrant informs works that deal with themes of alienation and borders. For a commission at an immigration services building, he created cloud sculptures to represent the turbulence and hope associated with waves of immigration.Manglano-Ovalle sees science as a worldview for contemporary artists, similar to how Renaissance artists related to theology. He aims to use art as a critical lens on dominant culture, employing tools like humor, irony and metaphor that may not be available to scientists.
