Michael Ray Charles is an African American artist known for his provocative works exploring racial stereotypes and American history. Born in 1967, Charles grew up in Louisiana and studied art at McNeese State University and the University of Houston, where he received his MFA. Charles's art often incorporates racist imagery and stereotypes from American popular culture, especially depictions of African Americans from the late 19th/early 20th century. He appropriates and recontextualizes these offensive caricatures and symbols in his paintings and installations as a way to confront their painful legacy and ongoing influence. A pivotal moment came in graduate school when a friend gave Charles an old racist figurine, which he initially dismissed but later realized could be a powerful vehicle for exploring American racial history. This led to his first major series featuring 50 baby carriages arranged like stars on an American flag.Charles sees beauty in history and evidence of having lived, even in ugly or painful imagery. He aims to evoke thought and encourage viewers to reconsider their understanding of race in America. His work often incorporates the Lincoln penny as a symbol questioning the reality of emancipation.While some have accused Charles of perpetuating stereotypes, he sees his work as questioning and getting close to uncomfortable truths about race relations. He believes these racist caricatures are part of both black and white American identity and linked to early marketing/advertising practices.Charles teaches art at the University of Texas at Austin. As a father, he prioritizes providing his children with a good environment to flourish, even if it means sacrificing career opportunities in New York. He wants to prepare them to live successfully anywhere in America.In his artistic process, Charles finds inspiration in everyday visual elements like signs, shadows, and light. He sees his paintings as a way to potentially make change and difference by encouraging new perspectives on race and American history. Charles continues to probe the complexities of racial imagery and its ongoing impact on American culture and identity.
