Matthew Ritchie is a contemporary artist known for his complex, multidisciplinary works exploring systems of knowledge and the nature of reality. Born in London in 1964, Ritchie studied at Camberwell School of Art before moving to New York in the 1980s. Drawing is central to Ritchie's artistic practice. He views drawing as an "infinite machine" that can be endlessly manipulated, scaled up or down, and translated into different media. Ritchie often begins with small drawings that are then scanned, digitally altered, and transformed into large-scale installations, paintings, and sculptures. A key focus of Ritchie's work is visualizing complex information systems and abstract concepts. He is fascinated by how humans organize knowledge and attempt to understand the universe. His intricate diagrammatic works often incorporate elements of science, mythology, religion, and philosophy. Ritchie sees his art as creating a kind of "armature" or framework for contemplating big questions about existence and reality.Ritchie's process often involves collaboration, using computer programs and working with fabricators to realize his visions at a large scale. He is interested in the tension between abstraction and figuration, seeing them as interconnected rather than opposed. His works frequently feature abstract forms that hint at recognizable figures or landscapes.Major projects by Ritchie include "The Morning Line," a massive outdoor sculpture/stage, and "The Universal Cell," a modular installation exploring ideas of containment and freedom. He has had solo exhibitions at major museums worldwide and his work is in collections including MoMA and the Guggenheim.Ritchie views art as a way to grapple with the overwhelming complexity of reality and information in the modern world. He aims to create immersive experiences that leave viewers questioning and contemplating big ideas, rather than providing easy answers. Through his intricate, layered works, Ritchie invites audiences to engage with abstract concepts and expand their ways of seeing and thinking about the world.
