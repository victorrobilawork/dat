Robert Adams is a photographer who has focused on documenting the American West for over 40 years. He began his career photographing the emerging suburban landscapes of Colorado in the 1960s. Initially thinking he was capturing things he disliked, he was surprised to find an unexpected beauty in the images when he developed them.Adams aims to show both the glorious aspects of the Western landscape and what has been disturbed or needs correction, often within the same frame. He seeks to create perfectly balanced compositions that reveal contradictions in the Western experience. Light plays a crucial role in his work, often providing a sublime quality even in seemingly desolate scenes.His process involves being open to surprises and "gifts" - unexpected images that emerge during shooting. Adams has produced many photography books, working closely with his wife Kerstin on editing and sequencing the images. He sees books as a way to reach a wider audience and allow for longer contemplation of the work.A major focus of Adams' later work has been deforestation in the Northwest. His book "Turning Back" documents the destruction of old growth forests and the spiritual exhaustion this represents. He sees a strong connection between people and trees, viewing time spent in nature as essential for spiritual health.Adams is motivated by a pursuit of beauty, which he sees as confirmation of meaning in life. However, he acknowledges this is a controversial stance in the art world. His work aims to balance documentation of environmental destruction with an appreciation for what remains beautiful in nature.
