Mike Kelley was an influential American artist known for his provocative, multi-disciplinary work exploring themes of repressed memory, trauma, and American culture. Born in Detroit, Kelley studied at the University of Michigan and CalArts before establishing himself in the Los Angeles art scene in the late 1970s.Kelley's work often incorporated found objects, particularly stuffed animals and other childhood artifacts. He explains that he initially used these materials to comment on commodity culture, but was surprised when viewers interpreted his work as being about child abuse. Rather than reject this interpretation, Kelley embraced it, using it as a springboard to explore cultural assumptions about trauma and memory.The artist discusses his project "Day is Done," a massive undertaking involving 365 video pieces based on high school yearbook photos. Kelley sees this work as a kind of materialist ritual, drawing on his Catholic upbringing while subverting religious traditions. He emphasizes the importance of humor and confusion in his work, aiming to create a "sublime play" that operates on multiple levels for different viewers.Kelley's creative process involves reacting to audience responses and cultural tropes, incorporating unexpected interpretations into his evolving body of work. He sees his role as an artist as providing a "negative aesthetic" that challenges social norms and expectations. Music plays a significant role in many of Kelley's projects, despite his lack of formal training.Throughout his career, Kelley pushed boundaries and defied easy categorization, working across mediums including performance, installation, sculpture, and video. His complex, often confrontational work has had a lasting impact on contemporary art, influencing generations of artists grappling with issues of memory, identity, and American culture.
