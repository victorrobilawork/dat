Collier Schorr is a contemporary American photographer known for her explorations of gender, identity, and adolescence. Growing up Jewish in New York, Schorr was fascinated by the "Aryan myth" that terrified her as a child reading books like The Diary of Anne Frank. This interest in confronting stereotypes and examining identity became a major theme in her work.Schorr began photographing high school wrestlers in the late 1990s, drawn to the intimate partnerships and range of emotions displayed in the sport. She saw wrestling as a rich metaphor for masculinity, allowing her to capture moments of both strength and vulnerability in young men. In 1994, Schorr began spending summers in Germany, photographing teenagers in a small town. This project allowed her to explore her Jewish identity in relation to German history. She had the teens pose in both American and German military uniforms, playing with ideas of nationality and historical memory. Schorr was interested in "fleshing up" buried histories and examining Germany's relationship to its past.A major work that emerged from this period was "The Helga Pictures," inspired by Andrew Wyeth's paintings of his model Helga. Schorr recreated these feminine poses with a young German man named Jens, exploring how gender is performed and perceived. This project exemplified Schorr's interest in ambiguity and fluidity of identity.Schorr does not have a traditional studio practice, preferring to work on location and build relationships with her subjects over time. She sees her process as collaborative, working closely with the people she photographs to create images that reveal intimate moments and complex emotions. Her work challenges fixed notions of gender, sexuality, and cultural identity by presenting ambiguous and multifaceted portrayals of her subjects.
