Richard Serra is a renowned sculptor known for his large-scale steel sculptures. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley and Yale University. Serra's artistic process involves starting with models rather than drawings or images. He is interested in how his sculptures relate to space and affect the viewer's experience of moving through and around them. Serra was inspired by watching ship launchings as a child, seeing massive objects become buoyant. He keeps notebooks to practice drawing and coordinate his hand and eye, a habit he started as a child to gain his parents' attention. Serra's sculptures often play with weight, balance, and the elasticity of steel. He aims to create new ways of looking at and experiencing space through his monumental works.Serra collaborates closely with steelworkers and fabricators to realize his visions. He sees his sculptures as generative, opening up new possibilities for future works. Serra is driven to keep inventing novel ways of shaping space and steel, always pushing boundaries in scale and form. His goal is to create startling, engaging experiences for viewers as they interact with his massive steel structures.
