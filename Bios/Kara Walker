Kara Walker is an African American artist known for her silhouette cutouts exploring race, gender, and identity. Born in 1969 in California, Walker moved to Georgia as a child, where she experienced the lingering effects of racism in the South. This influenced her later work examining the history and legacy of slavery. Walker studied art at the Atlanta College of Art and received her MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1994. Her breakthrough came with her 1994 mural "Gone: An Historical Romance of a Civil War as It Occurred b'tween the Dusky Thighs of One Young Negress and Her Heart." Using the genteel 18th century art form of silhouettes, Walker created provocative scenes of violence, sex, and subjugation in the antebellum South.Walker draws inspiration from sources like "Gone with the Wind," combining romanticized narratives of the Old South with brutal realities of slavery. She is interested in the "unexpected...wanting to be the heroine and yet wanting to kill the heroine at the same time." This tension drives her work. The silhouette form allows Walker to explore difficult subjects indirectly. She sees her work as "two parts research and one part paranoid hysteria," blending historical facts with fictional projections. Walker aims to implicate viewers, sometimes using overhead projectors so their shadows become part of the scene.Walker's work grapples with her identity as an African American woman artist and how to represent her world "given what you've been given." She sees her "Negress" character as both real and artificial. By skirting the line between fiction and reality, Walker examines race relations in America while questioning how we construct narratives about the past and present.
